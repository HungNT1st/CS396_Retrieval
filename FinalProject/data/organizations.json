Additionally, we have a small group of people who also love to play classic playing card games such as Canasta, Poker, and the like.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout the year, we will host tournaments for various card games with incentives such as card packs and deck accessories for the winner(s). If members so desire, the CGC can organize competitive teams for one or more of the aforementioned games. On a more casual side, throughout the semester, there will be players to teach card games to prospective players. Starter decks can be made available for interested players to learn the games. As a non-profit organization, all incidental proceeds from events and all profit from the club store will go towards expanding the store inventory. If members are not interested in competitive tournaments, they can feel free to meet new people, trade cards, and play friendly games with others.</p>\r\n<p>Our official Discord server can be joined here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discord.gg/XeS9xwz9aH\">https://discord.gg/XeS9xwz9aH</a></p>\r\n<p>Follow us on Instagram @UMass_CGC</p>", "Summary": "Interested in card games?

Registered Student Organizations, Graduate Student Organizations, and Student Affairs units may apply for grants in the following areas:</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;<strong>Co-curricular Engagement Grants</strong></p>\r\n<p>These grants allow students to collectively address their self-identified educational needs with appropriate skills and training. Alternatively, these grants can also assist groups who are interested in providing development and skill-building opportunities to their campus peers. Co-curricular development projects can include (but are not limited to) attendance at workshops, trainings, and/or conferences; providing trainings, lectures, or workshops to the campus community; and creating educational projects and media.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;<strong>Campus Connection Grants</strong></p>\r\n<p>These grants fund events that foster connections and build relationships across different parts of the campus community in unique and innovative ways, and serve as models for diverse community building. These events could include (but are not limited to) dances, performances, workshops, media, printed materials, and cultural nights. They can also include such things as group trips, on-campus conferences, or art exhibits. Collaborative proposals are encouraged. The goal should be to give members of the UMass Community opportunities to learn from each other, support each other, and express what's important to them.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;<strong>Service to Campus &amp; Community Grants</strong></p>\r\n<p>These grants engage students in ways that tangibly demonstrate their commitment to community building and civic responsibility across campus or with community and/or non-profit organizations that provide support for underserved populations. Preference is given for grants that (1) demonstrate a plan for evaluating their service effort and its outcomes and (2) engage community members/stakeholders in planning, implementing, and evaluating the project. These grants can include (but are not limited to) such projects as Alternative Spring Break (ASB) trips, volunteer community service, service-learning partnerships, fundraising events &amp; drives, and educational advocacy campaigns.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;<strong>Go UMass! Achievement Grants</strong></p>\r\n<p>These grants provide support for campus groups who have achieved success in their academic and co-curricular endeavors and would like support to showcase these achievements both on and off the UMass campus. Go UMass!

Our physical abilities are clearly inferior to those of apes. At least some of our cognitive abilities are known to be inferior to those of apes. But at some level of abstraction, humans emerge as the pinnacle of social beings.</p>\r\n<p>Is it our ability to communicate?

Despite these facts, most of survivors will still deal with chronic health issues throughout their life. The progress has been halted due to lack of funding.</p>\r\n<p>It is now in the hands of the general public to help push this research forward. Although the money we raise may be a scratch on the surface, our inspiration to others will be our biggest contribution.</p>\r\n<p>We achieve our goals by fundraising and donating items to Massachusetts hospitals. We raise money by hosting restaurant fundraisers, Judie's Art Bar paint nights, bake sales, and receiving money through small scale donation. We strive to improve the lives of pediatric cancer patients by making blankets and holiday cards to donate and taking trips to Ronald McDonald House.</p>\r\n<p>With our club's&nbsp;aid the whole world could benefit, leading us to a day where childhood cancer is better understood and can be treated and maybe even prevented more effectively.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "Summary": "This club focuses on donating money and goods to the Pediatric Cancer department of Massachusetts hospitals.

We are responsible for generating our own funding through various forms of fundraising, although the University does provide some nominal supplementary funding. We play matches with other rugby clubs at the collegiate level, mainly from the New England area.<br />The UMass WRFC plays its matches in the fall and spring and is a part of the New England Rugby Football Union (NERFU). We compete for the National Collegiate Championship, beginning with Division I league competition in New England in the fall.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is Rugby?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The simple description of rugby is that it is &ldquo;just football without the pads.&rdquo; In reality, rugby is much more complex than that. In fact, American Football is actually derived from rugby, so maybe we should be calling it &ldquo;rugby with helmets.&rdquo;<br />In rugby, any player may handle the ball, but only backwards passes are allowed. If a player has possession of the ball, they must be ahead of their teammates in the field of play. <br />There are no downs. When a tackle is made, play continues until a penalty is called, the ball goes out of bounds, or the half ends. Since rugby is continuous, all players must be skilled in both offensive and defensive strategy. There are no temporary substitutions.<br />Each team has fifteen players who remain on the field for the duration of the game. Positions are divided into two classes: forwards and backs. Players numbers 1-8 are the forwards, or the pack, who during the game must drive the ball forward, gain or retain possession, and get the ball out to the backs, who perform various passing plays. Games are eighty minutes long, split into two forty-minute halves. Women&rsquo;s rugby is the only sport with rules that are exactly the same as its men&rsquo;s counterpart.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do I join the UMass WRFC?</strong></p>\r\n<p>To join the team, all you have to do is come down to the field for the practices. We practice in the evenings Monday through Friday on the fields behind McGuirk Football Stadium. We play games on Saturdays and some Sundays, with home games at the same location as our practices.</p>\r\n<p>Do not be worried if you have never played rugby before. The majority of the team did not play before college. We appreciate anyone who has the courage to try a new sport.</p>\r\n<p>To be able to participate fully, you need to have a mouthguard and cleats (any besides softball cleats). We also recommend that you eventually get rugby shorts and socks, which you can order online or through the team.</p>\r\n<p>Our contact for new and interested players is our vice president, whose email is rugbywomen@umass.edu.

However, since the answers of different nations to these questions were not the same, they have been always involved in an undesirable interminable war. A war which was not mainly for the sake of the truth but rather for sustaining the relief obtained by their so called answers via physical elimination of opponents; just to get rid of their inside torture of unknown.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the enigmas that human has been involved in from prehistory hitherto, is the mysteries around sleeping and awareness. For example there were people who could dream about an event happening in the future; or as their body was in sleep, they started walking or talking; or sometimes they could see their own sleeping bodies from the above.</p>\r\n<p>These types of events were the origin of forming the beliefs which gradually expanded and made schools, philosophies and&nbsp;faiths.</p>\r\n<p>Venakey, which means &ldquo;entering to&nbsp;lightening&rdquo; is among these schools of thought and philosophies which has its root in human&rsquo;s curiosities and beliefs originated from prehistory. This school of thought is not based on the beliefs of just one nation but relied on all preliminary faiths of human kind.&nbsp; Conversely, it can be said that most of methods and beliefs are typically a branch of Venakey.</p>\r\n<p>The basis of this thought has its root in contemplation of ancient masters in the natural processes of sleeping. They observed that human sleeping has formed of three major stages:&nbsp;somatic (bodily),&nbsp;sensual&nbsp;and spiritual.&nbsp;The first stage is named somatic sleep that occurs early at night. In order to become calm and motionless, creature's body begins to be calmed down gradually until its excitation due to external stimuli and daily activities stops completely; like an electrical fan, which continues rotating after being turned off and slowly becomes motionless.</p>\r\n<p>In this stage people mostly dream their daily activities and after that according tothe ancient masters, they become suddenly awake which appears in the form of movement of sleeping person and then&nbsp; they enter into a deeper sleep stage; sensual stage.&nbsp;In this stage, subconscious mind starts resolving difficulties; it means that it reconstructs the obsessions,&nbsp;failed&nbsp;desires, fears and failures again in a new form and try to resolve and compensate them on the way the sleeping person desires. For instance, if he is defeated in a quarrel and be injured physically or hurt mentally during the day, he might dream a battle in which he is victorious over his opponent.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;After the sensual stage, dreamer enters into the third stage; spiritual one.&nbsp;By relaxation of body and also omission of inner turbulences, human mind gains the opportunity to perceive tiny intangible stimuli through hidden senses and unique perceptive channels by which he can dream very close to reality. This part of dream is influenced by sub-conscious mind and telepathic communication with surrounding. During this stage of sleep, the brain is more activated and its metabolism may increase up to 20%, in such a way that brain waves become similar to those of wakefulness; surprisingly this is a contradictory phenomenon in which although the person is asleep but the brain is in a awaken alike activity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s why, along the history, some great eastern masters decided to use sleeping for gaining knowledge and discovering the very existing universe through connecting to sub-conscious mind and telepathy waves. By these methods, they were not only able to be aware of future and past hidden events but also it turn possible for them to communicate with creatures such as plants, animals and non-organic beings. Therefore, they decided to set up some methods in order to attain&nbsp;spiritual dreaming (the third level of dream) in normal wakefulness. They knew that for attaining this level, bodily excitations and mind anxiety must reach to its minimum level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, internal dialogue must be completely extinguished; internal dialogue (talking internally to yourself) is a kind of talking by which people continuously review past, present and future of themselves and others; but mistakenly call it'' thinking'', whereas these dialogues are too scattered, inconsistent, irrelevant, sickening and chaotic to be called thought; which no logical relation can be found among them. This internal dialogue scatters mental power and decreasesawareness level as well as consuming a considerable amount of body&rsquo;s energy; and finally it&nbsp; disconnects the main attention of human being from environmental stimuli.</p>\r\n<p>Accordingly, they divided their methods and trainings (Venakey) into two parts. At First part, they used methods to extinguish internal dialogue compulsorily by deceiving mind, and conduct body to its most relaxing possible state, by which mind and body become relaxed and go deep into a sleeping similar sate.&nbsp; By this way, they could pass the conscious from somatic sleep stage in wakefulness. The second part of their training was designed for passing sensual sleep, regarding to the fact that sensual sleep is originated from mental excitations, which is imposed on human by environment or inner instincts; it was somewhat complicated, since the rate of domination on it was related to the rate of awareness and knowledge of human being mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ancient masters also recognized that human beings are unable to act merely based on their own knowledge. Hence they tried to made use of three special sensations fear, pleasure and love to&nbsp;instigate their followers to do their instructions seriously, since they found out that these three factors are the main motives of human kind.&nbsp; This is the fear of unknown which makes human beings fanatical. This is the greed of gaining more pleasure in the afterworld, which attracts people to do recommended religious percepts; and finally, this is through love which tolerating pains and shortcomings turns possible.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; At first stages, some masters proposed monastic life and staying away from any sensual excitations via establishing temples or seeking caves in faraway places trying to purge this stage of dream by which they could attain&nbsp;some good achievements.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Later, these schools of thought succeeded in exploring special remedial methods, via telepathic communication with plants and animals, including acupuncture, cupping (bleed by cupping) and&nbsp;herbal-therapy. By attaining special abilities in being connected to other creatures, they acquired more knowledge about the human being totality, the existing universe and truth which formed tenets of their philosophy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Ancient masters found out that independent of one&rsquo;s beliefs and thoughts and lifestyles, these methods can work. That is even without caring about complicated questions such as: where is our origin? What is our destiny? how has our childhood been passed and with whichdifficulties or how social beliefs influences (positively or negatively) our beliefs, we can still make a successful, calm, healthy , attractive, wise and powerful, positive and full of joy ones out of ourselves. We are still capable of being a novel human with versified personalities. Thus, they engaged in designing and training methods, which could help human beings to reach these goals.</p>\r\n<p>Venakey is a method which is originated from the ancient times. This method has been taught and developed academically since 1989 by Master Mohammad Babaee for the first time in modern times.&nbsp; Making this method worldwide, Master Mohmmad baabee has decided to proliferate it in USA.</p>\r\n<p>Functions:</p>\r\n<p>This method consists of two parts:&nbsp; Theoretical and Practical</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a.Theoretical:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In this part, the knowledge of ancient masters is taught by applying the latest physical, scientific and physiological findings to the students in order to change their viewpoint to negative environmental and sensorial stimulus and enhance their positive feelings in result. Consequently, their resistance and mental happiness will be improved.</p>\r\n<p>majority of people have minimum level of control on their negative physical and mental excitations and as a result physiological demands usually dominate their logical ones. Thus, for students who desire to improve their health quality, some techniques are taught which help them dominating their physiology more easily and lead their bodies and minds to health and tolerance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These techniques are included three major parts:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>1.Sub-conscious related techniques which are similar to hypnotism but not exactly the same.</li>\r\n<li>2.Bodily techniques such as breathing and specific forms of exercise.</li>\r\n<li>3.Mental techniques which are similar to meditation and concentration exercises but in a very special and unique manner.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Results:</p>\r\n<p>thousand years experience of ancient masters and 23 years of Master&nbsp; Mohammad Babaee&rsquo;s practical experience illustrates that this method leads to the following results:</p>\r\n<p>Physical effects:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enhancing the body Immune system and resistance to diseases.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Impressive improving of memory and learning skills</li>\r\n<li>Resolving&nbsp;many diseases like digestive diseases, Allergy, Muscular pains, obesity, insomnia, migraine, and many other physical illnesses.</li>\r\n<li>Improving the physical power&nbsp;and stamina&nbsp;for athletes and elders, enhancing the level of alertness and as a result increasing creativity and intelligence.</li>\r\n<li>Eliminating cramps and muscular pains caused by intense physical activities.</li>\r\n<li>Increasing&nbsp;happiness, energy, physical and mental spirit.</li>\r\n<li>The best replacement for sleep when awareness is needed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Spiritual and mental effects:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enhancing the level of mental resistance that causes the person to be more tolerant against social, environmental and familial adversities and act more effectively and accurately.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Renovation of individual&rsquo;s&nbsp;attitude to himself and his environment which results in better understanding of people and improving their relationship.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Dominance of happiness, hope and vitality over the agents and also the society.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Keywords: Spirituality, Spirit, Spiritual, Lucid Dreaming, Chakra, Meditation, Reiki, Tai chi, &nbsp;Qi Gong, Mantra, Spiritual Dance,&nbsp;yoga,&nbsp;Reiki,&nbsp;Healing,&nbsp;Aura Sight,&nbsp;Energy Healing,&nbsp;New Age,&nbsp;Metaphysics,&nbsp;Paranorma,&nbsp;Telepathy,&nbsp;Hypnosis</p>", "Summary": "Venakey is a method which is originated from the ancient times.

The Internet also plays a large role in improving education. However, over 4 billion people do not have access to the Internet, and their development is consequently stymied simply due to a lack of access. <br /><br />The World Librarians is an initiative developed at the University of Massachusetts Amherst that connects offline learners to open educational content in a democratic way. This initiative bridges the digital divide through inexpensive technology and Open Educational Resources. Created by a team of researchers who partnered with institutions across the globe, World Librarians has developed a workflow that connects an offline educational institution with the information it needs. First, a Requester, an individual from an offline educational institution, uses Twitter or e-Mule to request information. Second, a Searcher, a World Librarians team member with unlimited access to the Internet, looks for Open Access (e.g., Creative Commons) Licensed information. Third, the Searcher sends the relevant content to the Courier. Finally, the Courier, an individual or group with access to the Internet located in the area of the Requester, physically transports the data via USB drive to the Requester for their use. <br /><br />World Librarians is bridging the digital divide by providing open access information through a process titled Commons-based Peer Production or &ldquo;Peer Production&rdquo; for short. Rather than focusing on the provision of free Wi-Fi, World Librarians focus on the impact of the Internet: the ability to accelerate economic development by providing increased access to information. A UMass research team is currently working with a key partner in Malawi, Carl Meyer of a nonprofit ShiftIT, to improve access to educational information to a network of libraries and schools without access to the Internet. To do this, we developed a process that utilizes a device called a RACHEL (Remote Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning) Plus, which was created by World Possible, with the help of Intel. We also use technology to communicate with the institutions we are providing content to.
