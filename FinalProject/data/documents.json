Decisions regarding alterations to organization documents are detailed below.  \n\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n \n \n\fOfficers Defined:  \n\nThe elected officers of this organization shall be the following: The president, the vice president, the \ntreasurer and the Event Coordinator \n\nThe President \nDuties and Responsibilities: \n\u200b\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nShall be in charge of leadership and management of the Cornerstone Christian Ministry \nShall delegate organization of weekly bible discussions and other organization events \nShall schedule and preside over the organization meeting each semester \nShall communicate with university staff or delegate that authority \nShall work with the executive board to nominate future officers \n\nThe Vice President \nDuties and Responsibilities: \n\n-\n-\n-\n\nShall assist the President in the performance of his/her duties \nShall work with the executive board to nominate future officers \nShall hold signature responsibility \n\nThe Treasurer \nDuties and Responsibilities: \n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nShall be responsible for all financial matters pertaining to the Cornerstone Christian Ministry \nShall draft and submit a yearly budget request \nShall execute the financial business of the Cornerstone Christian Ministry \nShall appropriate funding and order materials and food for events \nShall hold signature responsibility \n\nThe Event Coordinator \nDuties and Responsibilities: \n\nShall be responsible for reserving rooms or other venues for all scheduled on campus events \nShall communicate with the university staff regarding the reservation of rooms and venues \n\n-\n-\n-\n\nTerm of Office: The term of office each officer shall be for one year only, from the election at the annual \nmeeting until a successor is chosen at the next annual meeting.  \n\nQualifications: Of the officers elected, all of them shall be undergraduates at the time of election and \nshall have been members at the time of the previous meeting. \n\nProcess for Elections and Nominations:  \n\nElections will be held during the spring semester meeting which will occur the first Friday  of March. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe process for elections will proceed as follows: \n\n1. The Current Executive Board will nominate voting members for each position and the President \n\nwill present these nominees to the group as a whole \n\n2. Voting  members will then have the opportunity to nominate themselves for candidacy \n3. After nominees for each position are established voting will proceed by the raising of hands in \n\nfavor of each nominee. \n\n4. The Vice President will record the number of votes each candidate receives \n5. Any candidate who receives \u2154 majority will be elected to the position for the following year \n6.

If no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the newly elected officers, shall name a qualified \n\nperson to fill the position.  \n\nRemoval from Office or Membership: \n\nA. Grounds for Removal: \n\nCornerstone Christian Ministry\n\nshall have the power to remove any of its \n\nofficers as provided in this section. The grounds for such removal shall be the infraction of the \nrules of The University of Massachusetts at Amherst and/or serious negligence in the discharge \nof the duties of that office.  \n\nB. Removal Procedures: The following procedures shall be followed in all proceedings leading to the \npossible expulsion of an officer and shall not exceed a 60-day time limit from the time of the \nresolution.  \n\n1) The executive board must unanimously agree to the removal of an officer or an RSO member. In \n\nthe case of the removal of an officer, the agreement must be unanimous among all the \nexecutive board officers except the officer in question. \n\n2) Once the above agreement has been reached, the executive board will contact said officer or \n\nmember via telephone or in person communication to communicate the decision and offer said \nofficer or member an opportunity to appeal the decision \n\n \n \n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n\f3)\n\n4)\n\nIn the case of an appeal, the executive board will meet with said officer or member to hear their \nappeal and revote. A unanimous agreement, excepting the officer in question, is once again \nrequired for their removal. \nIf the executive board once again votes in favor of removing said officer or member, an \norganization meeting will be held within one week to present the case to all voting members. \nMembers will vote whether or not to remove said officer or member, and a \u2154 majority will be \nrequired for their removal. \n\nFreedom of Speech/Expression: \n\nThe Cornerstone Christian Ministry will allow each member and visitor of the organization the right to \nrespectfully express his/her opinion. All members will have the opportunity to make their opinion \nknown and heard. Under no circumstances shall a member\u2019s freedom of speech or expression be \n. \ninfringed\n\nNon-Discrimination: \n\nMembership is regularly open to all undergraduate and graduate students at the University of \nMassachusetts at Amherst and faculty of the University as well as the five college school system and \nschools in the area, regardless of race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or physical \nability. The organization prohibits discriminations under Federal and State law based on, but not limited \nto, the above attributes. \n\nAmendments: \n\nThe procedure for amending the organization\u2019s constitution or charter is as follows: \n\n1) During the meeting held each semester voting members and officers may propose changes that \n\n2)\n\nthey wish to incorporate into the constitution or charter. \nIf the proposed change is possible and favorable, the executive board will then meet \nindependently to discuss and draft these changes.  \n\n3) The executive board will then hold a second meeting within the same semester to present the \nproposed change to the voting members who will vote whether to incorporate the change into \nthe club constitution or charter. A \u2154 majority vote is required for changes to be incorporated. \n\nRatification of Constitution: \n\n \n\u200b\n \n \n \n\fShall be voted on by a 2/3rds majority of the organization, approved by the Secretary of Registry, and \nthen the changes will be made and the new constitution will be printed and available for all members. \n\nFuture Goals:  \n\nOur goals for the future of this organization include continued annual growth of the group as well as to \nhost events on campus that will stimulate the spiritual thoughts of the UMass body. These events will \ninclude ideas such as church services, religious and biblical lectures on how we can view the bible and \ncurrent issues, presentations concerning evidence for the bible and Christianity, finding opportunities to \nserve the Pioneer Valley community, and many more. \n\nReason for RSO Status: \n\nTo demonstrate that our organization does not duplicate the mission of any of the existing organizations \nhere at the college, this section will distinguish our organization from ten currently existing Christian \norganizations. Though there is much that unites us with these organizations, our specific emphases \nclearly distinguish us from them. \n\nChi Alpha Christian Fellowship: \n\n\u201cChi Alpha is a community united by faith, love and commitment to Jesus Christ. We are a group of \n\nseekers, skeptics, and serious followers of Jesus.  We are students, staff, faculty, and others who \nget together on campus to draw closer to God and to one another. We welcome students, faculty \nand staff from all backgrounds to join us on our journey we call \"life.\" \n\nThe root of our organization is in the Restoration movement which is not the focus of Chi Alpha Christian \n\nFellowship, which will distinguish Cornerstone Christian Fellowship from it. \n\nMERCY House Nights: \n\n\u201cVita Nova is an Acts 29 and 2020 Vision church in Amherst, Massachusetts that began in April of 2009.  \nWe are committed to loving the Pioneer Valley and making  it a better area to live in.  We desire \nto bring the hope of Jesus to the sick and suffering of our town, while at the same time engaging \nwith culture, loving artists through our art gallery and art lessons, and helping local businesses \n\u201d \nby encouraging our congregation to support them financially and tip generously\n\u200b\n\nThe focus of MERCY House Nights seems to be based in the arts, while the focus of Cornerstone \n\nChristian Fellowship is to be centered on the restoration movement and how that can be applied \nin the student body. \n\nIntervarsity Christian Fellowship: \n\n\u201cAdvancing God's kingdom through whole life conversion to Jesus Christ, moving students from cynics to \n\nseekers to followers to leaders to world changers.\u201d \n\n \n\fThere is no focus from the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship on the unique Restoration movement, or any \n\ntype of discussions on campus. Therefore there is no link to Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. \n\nAdventist Christians (ACTS): \n\n\u201cAdventist Christians Together to Serve is a religious affiliated group that serves to provide the \n\nopportunity to become acquainted with and enjoy the fellowship of Christian students, faculty, \nand staff, to promote social and spiritual growth, to encourage members in personal service and \ncommunity outreach and to provide opportunity for meaningful discussions by members of the \ngroup on-issues concerning, Christianity at large and the Seventh-day Adventist denomination in \nparticular. It is an inviting opportunity to all.\u201d \n\nThe Restoration Movement is completely distinct from the Seventh-day Adventist Church; therefore, \nCornerstone Christian Ministry is very different from the Adventist Christians (ACTS). \n\nEpic Movement at UMass: \n\n\u201cThe purpose of Epic Movement at UMass is to encourage, promote and foster the spiritual, emotional, \nand social health of Asian Americans students, through open dialog  and discussions about the \nperson of Jesus Christ, and service, education and counseling for the Asian American student \ncommunity here at UMass.  The discussions, while centering on Jesus Christ, will be separate \nform any organized church group or denominational identification in order that students at \nUMass may more readily bring logical, philosophical, cultural, historical and academic questions \nconcerning Jesus Christ into open intellectual discussions in a open and neutral setting without \nreference to denominational affiliation.  This separation from any organized church group is for \nthe achievement of more open discussion of Jesus Christ\u2019s person and mission; this separation is \ncertainly not of Epic Movement members from their churches.  Epic Movement will encourage \nmember to participate in the service and activities of the church of their choice. In order to fulfill \nthe purpose to which we organize ourselves, we plan to organize, weekly meetings, Bible studies, \nand events that will raise awareness of spiritual, social and emotional issues for Asian \nAmericans.\u201d \n\nPrimarily, Cornerstone Christian Ministry is not specifically \u201cAsian-American,   Cornerstone Christian \nMinistry\u2019s emphasis on the Restoration Movement distinguishes it from Epic Movement at \nUMass. \n\nCampus Crusade for Christ (Campus Crusade) \n\n\u201cUmass Cru is a community that loves Jesus and everything that he is about. His message, his person, his \n\nlove and example has captured our hearts and we are changed forever. We exist to serve as a \nresource to the UMass community, intelligently communicating how the claims of Jesus Christ \nare relevant to everyone today. We also help students to grow spiritually, academically, in \ncharacter, leadership and relationships. And we have lots of fun while doing it!\u201d \n\n\fWhile many of the goals of the Cornerstone Christian Ministry overlap with those of Christians on \nCampus, our unique emphasis on the Restoration Movement, a movement often times at \ndoctrinal odds with \u201cmainstream\u201d Protestantism, distinguishes us.  \n\nBrothers and Sisters in Christ (B.A.S.I.C.) \n\n\u201cOur mission is to share the gospel of Jesus Christ to the students on this local campus as well as the \nsurrounding areas; to see many souls being saved and won over to His kingdom, and lastly to \nhelp individuals that already have a relationship with Christ foster growth; and this is done by \nhaving Sunday services twice a month, weekly Bible study, weekly e-board meetings, and prayer \nmeetings.\u201d \n\nAgain, Cornerstone Christian Ministry\n\nwill have a much more specific focus than B.A.S.I.C.; although both \norganizations share similar pursuits, Cornerstone Christian Ministry emphasis on the Restoration \nMovement clearly distinguishes it from B.A.S.I.C. \n\n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCentral Objective of the \u201cCornerstone Christian Ministry\u201d \n\nThe central objective of CCM shall be to enrich understanding of Christianity and of the Stone-Campbell \nRestoration Movement among UMass faculty and students. \n\nTo accomplish this, CCM would focus its efforts into small, weekly discussion groups about faith, \nspirituality, and religion. These groups would be designed not only to discuss Christianity, but also to \nallow people of all faiths to discuss what they believe. CCM would also seek to sponsor and organize \noccasional larger activities and events related to its purpose, such as church meetings and speeches. \n\nMembers of CCM seek both a broader and deeper understanding of faith and spirituality as manifested \nin the realm of religious communities. We believe this understanding is vital to our educations and to \nour lives, regardless of our own religious views; through it, we gain insight into the cultures, identities, \nand philosophies of communities all over the world. \n\nVarious religious organizations exist at UMass, many of which are designed specifically for certain faiths. \nIn the same way, CCM exists primarily to contribute knowledge and perspective of the Stone-Campbell \nRestoration Movement to the ongoing interfaith dialogue at UMass, providing a unique religious voice \nthat prior to now has been absent or silent. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement \n\nThe Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement, also known simply as the Restoration Movement, is a \nChristian Protestant reform movement that became prominent in America during the Second Great \nAwakening of the 18th and 19th centuries. Several Christian denominations \u2013 the Disciples of Christ, the \nIndependent Christian Churches, the Churches of Christ, the International Churches of Christ, and the \nnon-institutional Churches of Christ, among others \u2013 trace their roots to this movement. All told, there \nare millions of Christians in the United States and across the world whose beliefs have been influenced \nby Barton W. Stone, Alexander Campbell, and other similar reformers. \n\nSeveral factors distinguish Restoration Movement denominations from other Protestant denominations. \n(Ironically, one of these is that churches within Restoration Movement often label themselves \n\u201cnon-denominational,\u201d emphasizing the potential unity of the Body of Christ.) Almost all practice adult \nbaptism for the remission of sins and a weekly celebration of the Lord's Supper; most reject original sin, \npredestination, and faith alone. The Restoration Movement is relatively unique in that its members have \nhistorically preferred autonomy and congregational polities, as opposed to episcopal or presbyterian \npolities. It is strongly associated with Christian primitivism, or the idea that modern Christians should \nattempt to restore (hence \u201cRestoration movement\u201d), in part or in full, the practices and beliefs of the \noriginal Christian Church; with this in mind, many denominations within the Restoration Movement have \nsought to avoid post-biblical traditions and creeds, and Restoration Movement scholarship often focuses \non early Christian beliefs, writings, and practices. There is not, of course, complete unanimity within the \nmovement; a spectrum of beliefs exists concerning issues such as the Trinity, instrumental worship, and \nrebaptism. \n\n \n \n \n\f"}, {"Name": "cornerstone_christian_fellowship Final Allocation FY16.xlsx", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "FY16 Final Budget allocations", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "FY15 FINAL Budget Allocation", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "FY15 Initial Allocation", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}]}, {"Name": "Alpha Phi Omega", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Alpha Phi Omega Intial Allocation FY16.xlsx", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "FY16 Final Budget Allocation", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "FY16_Budget_Workbooks_Temp.

Graduate students and Five College \nundergraduate students are not eligible to hold UBDC leadership positions as per Student \nActivities and Involvement (SAI) policy. \nB. Membership shall be established after a prospective member signs the club contract/ \nliability waiver and pays dues. Prospective members will then be added to the Campus \nPulse roster and will remain active members if they attend weekly meetings.  For liability \nand safety concerns, as well as according to SAI regulations, members who do not sign \nthe contract or pay dues will be unable to be members of UBDC. \nC. Dues, the cost of which are subject to change every semester depending on club needs, \nare collected by the Treasurer at the beginning of every new semester to aid with the cost \nof props \na\nissues, etc. They are to be in a sealed envelope with the member's name and email written \non it with exact change inside. All prospective members of UBDC are required to pay \ndues except for graduate students and Five College students (because they pay to use the \nrec-center each week) and those with demonstrated financial need. Any member who \ndemonstrates financial need to the Treasurer will be exempt from paying dues. Once dues \nhave been paid, the Treasurer will add members names to a Google document to keep \ntrack of who has paid. \nD. Club Contract: The UBDC member contract will be enforced by the general board and \nfollowed at all times by every member. It will be given to every new member at the start \nof each semester and kept on file by the Secretary for returning members until they \ngraduate or leave UBDC (unless changes have been made to the contract each person was \ngiven in previous semesters). The Secretary is responsible for the collection and \ndistribution of the contract and liability waivers from SAI. They will later input all names \ninto a Google document to keep track of who has signed it. The forms will be put into a \nbinder for the Secretary to maintain. The contract will be reviewed by the board who will \n\n \n \n \n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\fdecide to make changes if necessary at the end of every semester. If changes are made, it \nwill be re-distributed to the group at the start of the semester.  \n\nThe contract is as follows: \n\nUMass Belly Dance Club Member Contract: \n\n I hereby agree to read, understand, and follow the guidelines set forth in this contract in \n\norder to be an official member of UBDC: \n\n1. During UBDC meetings and rehearsals, we have specific goals to reach: \n\nevents to plan, and exciting news to share about \n\nchoreography to teach and learn, \nperformances.  So that we can reach these goals together and refrain from distracting \nothers during our practice time, we ask that everyone gives the instructors their full \nattention and listens actively while they are speaking. Instructors will ask if anyone has \nquestions or needs extra help while learning our group dances. Questions and comments \nare welcomed at this time. By raising your hand, an instructor can answer your \nquestion(s), take you aside to assist you or you may share your ideas with the group. \n\n2. To attend UBDC practices and perform, prospective members must sign forms \nand pay dues at the beginning of each semester, attend practices regularly, and come to \npractice on time. Forms will be collected by the Secretary on the date that they specify. \nFinancial issues may be brought to the attention of the Treasurer who will assist should \nthe need arise (please do not let cost keep you from joining UBDC).  5 College \nundergraduate students do not need to pay dues as they must pay to enter the Rec Center. \nAll paperwork and dues need to be turned in within the time frame that the Treasurer will \nannounce at the beginning of the semester. They are to be in a sealed envelope with exact \nchange inside. The front of the envelope must include your  name and email address. \n Dues that are not paid on time will result in a meeting with the Treasurer to discuss \nfinancial situations or an inability to attend practices/events. After paying dues, members \nwill be invited to the Campus Pulse roster via email and need to accept to complete \nmembership. They will also be invited to join our UBDC members-only Facebook group.   \n\n3.\n\n  UBDC\u2019s members will be informed of performance opportunities as they arise. \n\nPerforming is always optional. All members are expected to answer polls, posts, or \nemails regarding availability for performing in a timely manner. Even if you cannot \nperform, it is more helpful to know that you cannot make it than to have no idea if we \nwill have enough members present to perform. At performances, members are expected \nto arrive on time and present themselves in a manner that is respectful to the club and \nbelly dance as an art form. Costumes are ordered online by every performer individually \n(unless otherwise specified) and you must do it within a timely manner to be able to \nperform and avoid shipping issues. Again, should financial or ordering issues occur, \ncontact the Costume Coordinator or the Treasurer for assistance. Never let cost keep you \nfrom performing!\npractice spaces or the performance stage (for example, in a dining common while getting \ndinner after a show). Walking around in costume before or after events without a form of \ncover up is not permitted as it is unprofessional and we do not want our audience \n\nMembers should not wear belly dance costumes anywhere other than \n\n \n\u200b\n \n \n\u200b\n \n \n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n\fmembers seeing the costumes before we perform. Examples of exceptions include tabling \nat the activities expo or taking a picture with friends after a show.  Ask an instructor if \nyou have any questions about this.  Performing is a privilege. If practices are not attended \nand choreography is not learned, a member will  lose the ability to perform. Valid \nexcuses given in a timely manner (at least 24 hours in advance) for missed rehearsal time \ninclude papers/projects, exams, and emergencies like sickness, injury, family issues, etc. \nIf three regular club practices are missed after the mid-semester date, a member will not \nbe allowed to perform if they do not make up the time at an optional practice session.  \n\n4.\n\n UBDC is not responsible for the individual actions and decisions of members at \n\nevents that are not club-sponsored. This includes, but is not limited to social events, \nprofessional belly dance gigs, and outside practices led by members and not UBDC \ninstructors (Executive Board).  Any UBDC member who performs professionally at an \nevent that is not sponsored by UBDC is expected to perform as an individual under their \nown name and not as a member of UBDC. \n\n5.\n\nMembers who borrow props from UBDC will have to sign a contract before\nthey are allowed to take the prop from a club practice. The secretary will handle all\ncontracts. If the props are not returned by the end of the semester, the member who\nsigned them out will lose borrowing privileges and will have to pay to replace the prop.\nThey will not be permitted to take out another prop until the missing one is recollected or\nreplaced. Anyone who returns props damaged will have to pay the club for the\nreplacement of pieces or the entire prop. \n\n6.\n\n      UBDC members are expected to be accepting and respectful of all races, \n\nethnicities, religions, classes, gender orientations, and identities.   If a member of UBDC \nviolates our atmosphere of mutual respect in any manner at any time or place, (whether at \nmeetings, events or via social media, etc), they will be notified that their standing will be \ndiscussed by the UBDC Board and depending on the severity of the case, they may \nreceive a formal warning or if necessary, may not remain a member of the club. \n\nIn closing, our members uphold the mission of the UMass Belly Dance Club which is to \nteach and perform the beautiful and ancient art of belly dance at the University of Massachusetts \nAmherst. UBDC\u2019s goal is to inspire and empower students to celebrate and love their bodies \nregardless of size, age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or ability; thus raising self \nesteem and promoting a community of acceptance. UBDC\u2019s passion is to share these goals, \nvalues, and talents with the UMass Amherst community. Our goal this year is to have fun \ndancing together as a belly dance family and community, host great events, and help one another \nimprove dance skills in an inclusive, fun and welcoming environment.   \n\nBy signing, I agree to the terms of this contract: \n\nSignature and Date: \nPrinted Name:                                                     \n\u200b\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fII.

If a member intends to perform, weekly rehearsals \nare mandatory as missing three practices without a valid excuses given in a timely manner (at \nleast 24 hours in advance) for missed rehearsal time including: papers/projects, exams, and \nemergencies like sickness, injury, family issues, etc.; will result in the inability to perform. By \nparticipating in a Mullins Center cleaning shift, members can earn one free absence. Rehearsals \nand meetings are for the purpose of warming up, teaching choreography and technique, \npracticing, and/or event planning.  \nB. Meetings and rehearsals will be instructed and led by the President and Vice President who \nwill be assisted by the Secretary and Treasurer for clarity. The President and Vice-President are \nresponsible for creating UBDC\u2019s choreographies together. They must seek feedback from the \nSecretary and Treasurer, but will take on the majority of the choreographing responsibility. \nThese teachers should be aware that movements or parts of the choreography may not always be \nliked or doable by the general body. Other members should be encouraged to give their input on \nthe choreography during rehearsals as long as it doesn\u2019t inhibit productivity during practices.  \nC. Weekly board meetings will be attended by all board members for the purposes of planning. \n\nIII.

If nobody chooses to run against them, they will be \nawarded their position if they have been found to complete their duties completely and \nefficiently in the previous year. \n\n\u25cf At the end of each year, the general body will be informed about elections; any member \nof UBDC who has been an active member of UBDC for two consecutive semesters may \nrun for a board position.  \n\n\u25cf Board Positions will not be awarded to members who are found to be unqualified for the \nposition they are running for even if they are running unopposed. Every effort should be \nmade to speak to qualified individuals and encourage their election participation if need \nbe.If someone is qualified for a position that they did not run for and they lose the \n\n \n \n \n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n \n \n\felection for the position they originally wanted, they may be invited to serve in another \nposition if they are qualified and sent in the proper application materials.  \n\n* New officers should be elected in the spring after spring break to ensure enough time to \ntrain under the current officers until they leave the position. New officers are officially in \ntheir position after the last day of classes during the Spring semester. \n\n1. The required traits for all UBDC board members are as follows: \n\n\u25cf A board member must be mature, warm, welcoming, responsible, trustworthy and \n\npositive. \n\n\u25cf Dedication to the club is a MUST. This member must have displayed dedication by \ncoming to the majority of meetings every week on time for at least two consecutive \nsemesters, perform often, volunteer, assist in fundraising efforts, etc. \n\n\u25cf Public speaking skills: this will be crucial when it comes to teaching the group. Board \n\nmembers should be comfortable speaking in front of a large group of people.  Teachers: \n(Executive Board) should be comfortable dancing, teaching, improving and performing in \nfront of large groups. \n\n\u25cf Timely and organized: Board members must be dedicated enough to take on the \n\nresponsibility of helping to run UBDC and be able to balance these responsibilities with \nother aspects of student life. \n\n\u25cf The member must be a positive role model inside and outside UBDC. \n\nEveryone who embodies these qualities is eligible for a leadership position: UBDC will \nnever be biased against different gender identities, body types, class, race/ethnicity, \nbackgrounds, etc. \n\nFor the election of general board members positions\n\n2.\n: The President will inform the general \nbody of when elections will be. They will then compile a list of the members who are interested \nin each position.  They will collect 1-2 paragraph long statements from each candidate stating \nwhy they want to be considered for the position and why they think they would be the best \ncandidate. \n\nThe board will later discuss and decide if the candidates are eligible and offer positions to the \nmost dedicated, well-rounded candidate. This discussion will take place when the candidates are \nnot present. Each board member will submit an anonymous vote which will be tallied by the \nboard. These votes will determine the next elected board members. The President will inform all \ncandidates of the election outcome via email.  They will also inform the general body members \nhowever they see fit (campus pulse, email, Facebook page, etc). If a current board member is \nleaving their position and wants to apply for a new one, they must go through the same statement \nprocess and will not be eligible for the discussion and selection of that position.  \n\n3.\n\nFor the election of Executive Board Members:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n \n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n\fThe President will inform the general body of when elections will be.\nThey will compile a list of \nthe members who are interested in the position. Candidates must submit a written statement (1-2 \nparagraphs) to the board stating why they want to be considered for the position and why they \nthink they would be the best candidate.They must teach the general board a short choreography \nfor ten minutes and answer all questions that board members ask during and after the lesson (the \nchoreography should not take ten minutes to learn, but the process of teaching it and having the \nboard able to do it should take ten minutes). Finally, candidates must submit a video of a solo of \nat least two minutes in length to the board. After a final question and answer session, the entire \nboard will meet to discuss the candidates and decide who will fill each position by filling out an \nanonymous rubric based on the candidate\u2019s teaching and leadership.  The rubric scores will be \ntallied by the board together. This will determine the next elected board members. The President \nwill inform all candidates and general body members of the outcome. Any current board member \nrunning for a position will not be included in the voting or rubric process for the election of the \nposition they wish to receive.  \n\nAlong with the required traits for all UBDC officers: anyone who is applying for teaching \npositions within UBDC (Executive Board) must have the following qualities which will be \nincluded in the election scoring rubric: \n\n\u25cf They must be consistently present and on time to all general body meetings, \n\nperformances, and board meetings (if they were previously a member of the board). \n*This point weighs heavily on the Executive Board rubric. \n\n\u25cf They should be able to display an ability to choreograph versatile dance pieces by \n\nparticipating actively in UBDC meetings/performances. Other ways to show an active \ninterest in expanding one\u2019s dance abilities can include:  Displaying a knowledge of belly \ndance and its numerous techniques and styles by research and by taking extra classes \n(such as belly dance group fit classes at the Rec-center or extra classes with a \nprofessional) and performing their own solos often.  *This point weighs heavily on the \nExecutive Board rubric. \n\n\u25cf They must display an ability to balance teaching, choreographing, attending meetings \n(general body, board, SAI, RSO adviser, SAI trainings, etc) and leading UBDC. \n\n\u25cf They must show an ability to handle stressful situations and adversity should difficulties \n\nwithin UBDC arise. \n\n\u25cf They must have performed a solo (prior to the election process) that is their original \nchoreographed work and at least two minutes in length. To count, the solo must be \nperformed at a UBDC sponsored event (i.e. our Festival) or at an event UBDC has been \ninvited to perform for. Events that have audiences made up of only UBDC members \n(such as our Hafla) do not count \n\n\u25cf Most importantly, the new elected Executive Board should have a passion for belly dance \n\nand sharing this beautiful art form with others. This member should exude a strong \npassion for the club and belly dance as an art. They should add to and maintain the club\u2019s \natmosphere of friendship and respect. \n\n \n\u200b\n \n\u200b\n \n \n\f*UBDC teachers do not have to be certified belly dance instructors, however, the executive \nboard is strongly encouraged to do at least one workshop with an area certified instructor to \ngain technique with a respected, researched and established instructor.  \n\nIV. General Board/ Executive Board Member and General Body Member Removal: \n\nA.  Any officer who displays a lack in responsibility in their position or violates the \ncontract of UBDC should be given a written formal warning by the President. Should the \nbehavior persist after a written warning, the President will call a board meeting and the \ngroup will discuss and vote on the status of the board member. Any member who puts the \nsafety of another board member or general body member in jeopardy will lose their board \nposition and/or UBDC membership if there is proof of the incident. If the President \nviolates the UBDC contract or displays a lack of responsibility in their position, the \nVice-President is eligible to give them a written formal warning or call a board meeting \nto discuss their standing if the behavior persists. If the Vice-President and President are \nboth in violation, any board member may contact the UBDC adviser to discuss the \nsituation.  \nB. If the board member in question has never received a written warning, but has behaved \nin a way that warrants a meeting about their status, the board must unanimously agree to \nremove them from their position. If the member has received one verbal and one written \nwarning, one more than half of the board must agree to remove them from their position \nand the UBDC advisor must approve of the decision. If the group cannot make a \ndecision, the member in question will state their case to the group's adviser who will \nmake the final decision. \nC. General body members who behave in any manner that violates the contract of UBDC \nor puts the safety of a member of UBDC in jeopardy will immediately have their status as \na member be discussed by the board. The member will receive a verbal warning about \nsaid behavior, then a written warning, and if the behavior persists, the board will vote on \ntheir membership status if there is proof of the incident.  If the group cannot make a \ndecision, the member in question will state their case to the group's adviser who will \nmake the final decision. \n\nV. Resolving Disputes \n\n\u25cf If anyone on the board witnesses or is made aware of behavior that makes other members \nuncomfortable and/or disrupts the club, every board member has the right to ask any \nmember to engage in a private conversation about the behavior either before, during or \nafter the club meeting in the most polite and discreet manner possible. This is to prevent \nfurther disruptions, address strife head on and prevent disputes in the future. \n\n\u25cf If a member feels they are being disrespected or feels uncomfortable, they should go \ndirectly to one of the board members as soon as possible.  It will be dealt with as the \ngeneral board sees fit.   \n\n\u25cf Any board member is allowed to contact the club\u2019s adviser for assistance at any time for \n\nany reason.  \n\n\u25cf Mediated meetings among members or board members with an adviser or the head of \nSAI may be called by the President or any other board member should they see fit. \n\n \n \n \n\f\u25cf The President with the assistance of the board if necessary, will mediate disputes between \nall members including board members. Should the need arise, a representative from SAI \nor adviser may mediate.  \n\n\u25cf Should the President be involved in a dispute, or should any party not be satisfied with \nthe result of the President's mediation, any party may request that the RSO adviser shall \nmediate. The results of mediated conversations with the adviser shall be final. \n\u25cf If the issue does not pertain to UBDC or belly dance, the President and the board if \n\nnecessary should suggest resources and work with the UBDC adviser to suggest the best \nsolution. \n\n\u25cf If a member has been found to be making threats against other members, or if any \n\nmember is in physical, emotional, or mental danger, then an SAI advisor will be notified \nimmediately.  \n\n\f"}, {"Name": "Spring2016ConstitutionFinal.docx", "Data": "Mission Statement\n\nThe mission of the UMass Belly Dance Club (UBDC) is to teach and perform the beautiful and ancient art of belly dance at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. UBDC\u2019s goal is to inspire and empower students to celebrate and love their bodies regardless of size, age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or ability; thus raising self esteem and promoting a community of acceptance. UBDC\u2019s passion is to share these goals, values, and talents with the UMass Amherst community. \n\nAll members of the UMass Belly Dance Club are entitled to freedom of speech and will not under any circumstances be deprived of the opportunity to share their opinion with the group.\nUnder no circumstances will a member or potential member of the UMass Belly Dance Club be discriminated against due to race, ethnicity, gender, age, orientation, religion or other identities.\n\n\nI. Membership\nA. All Five College Consortium undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to be a UBDC member. Any Non-Umass Student will have to pay to use the Recreation Center for practices as per Rec Center policy. The majority of this group must be made up of undergraduate UMass Amherst students. Graduate students and Five College undergraduate students are not eligible to hold UBDC leadership positions as per Student Activities and Involvement (SAI) policy.\nB. Membership shall be established after a prospective member signs the club contract/ liability waiver and pays dues. Prospective members will then be added to the Campus Pulse roster and will remain active members if they attend weekly meetings. \u00a0For liability and safety concerns, as well as according to SAI regulations, members who do not sign the contract or pay dues will be unable to be members of UBDC.\nC. Dues, the cost of which are subject to change every semester depending on club needs, are collected by the Treasurer at the beginning of every new semester to aid with the cost of props and prop repair, event planning costs, costume costs for those with financial issues, etc. They are to be in a sealed envelope with the member's name and email written on it with exact change inside. All prospective members of UBDC are required to pay dues except for graduate students and Five College students (because they pay to use the rec-center each week) and those with demonstrated financial need. Any member who demonstrates financial need to the Treasurer will be exempt from paying dues. Once dues have been paid, the Treasurer will add members names to a Google document to keep track of who has paid.\nD. Club Contract: The UBDC member contract will be enforced by the general board and followed at all times by every member. It will be given to every new member at the start of each semester and kept on file by the Secretary for returning members until they graduate or leave UBDC (unless changes have been made to the contract each person was given in previous semesters). The Secretary is responsible for the collection and distribution of the contract and liability waivers from SAI. They will later input all names into a Google document to keep track of who has signed it.\u00a0The forms will be put into a binder for the Secretary to maintain. The contract will be reviewed by the board who will decide to make changes if necessary at the end of every semester. If changes are made, it will be re-distributed to the group at the start of the semester. \n\nThe contract is as follows: UMass Belly Dance Club Member Contract:\n\n I hereby agree to read, understand, and follow the guidelines set forth in this contract in order to be an official member of UBDC:\n\nDuring UBDC meetings and rehearsals, we have specific goals to reach: choreography to teach and learn, events to plan, and exciting news to share about performances.  So that we can reach these goals together and refrain from distracting others during our practice time, we ask that everyone gives the instructors their full attention and listens actively while they are speaking. Instructors will ask if anyone has questions or needs extra help while learning our group dances. Questions and comments are welcomed at this time. By raising your hand, an instructor can answer your question(s), take you aside to assist you or you may share your ideas with the group.\n\nTo attend UBDC practices and perform, prospective members must sign forms and pay dues at the beginning of each semester, attend practices regularly, and come to practice on time. Forms will be collected by the Secretary on the date that they specify.  Financial issues may be brought to the attention of the Treasurer who will assist should the need arise (please do not let cost keep you from joining UBDC).  5 College undergraduate students do not need to pay dues as they must pay to enter the Rec Center. All paperwork and dues need to be turned in within the time frame that the Treasurer will announce at the beginning of the semester. They are to be in a sealed envelope with exact change inside. The front of the envelope must include your  name and email address. \u00a0Dues that are not paid on time will result in a meeting with the Treasurer to discuss financial situations or an inability to attend practices/events. After paying dues, members will be invited to the Campus Pulse roster via email and need to accept to complete membership. They will also be invited to join our UBDC members-only Facebook group.  \n  \n   3.  \tUBDC\u2019s members will be informed of performance opportunities as they arise. Performing is \nalways optional. All members are expected to answer polls, posts, or emails regarding availability for performing in a timely manner. Even if you cannot perform, it is more helpful to know that you cannot make it than to have no idea if we will have enough members present to perform. At performances, members are expected to arrive on time and present themselves in a manner that is respectful to the club and belly dance as an art form. Costumes are ordered online by every performer individually (unless otherwise specified) and you must do it within a timely manner to be able to perform and avoid shipping issues. Again, should financial or ordering issues occur, contact the Costume Coordinator or the Treasurer for assistance. Never let cost keep you from performing! Members should not wear belly dance costumes anywhere other than practice spaces or the performance stage (for example, in a dining common while getting dinner after a show). Walking around in costume before or after events without a form of cover up is not permitted as it is unprofessional and we do not want our audience members seeing the costumes before we perform. Examples of exceptions include tabling at the activities expo or taking a picture with friends after a show.  Ask an instructor if you have any questions about this.  Performing is a privilege. If practices are not attended and choreography is not learned, a member will  lose the ability to perform. Valid excuses given in a timely manner (at least 24 hours in advance) for missed rehearsal time include papers/projects, exams, and emergencies like sickness, injury, family issues, etc. If three regular club practices are missed after the mid-semester date, a member will not be allowed to perform if they do not make up the time at an optional practice session. \n\n       4. \tUBDC is not responsible for the individual actions and decisions of members at events that are \nnot club-sponsored. This includes, but is not limited to social events,  professional belly dance gigs, and outside practices led by members and not UBDC instructors (Executive Board).  Any UBDC member who performs professionally at an event that is not sponsored by UBDC is expected to perform as an individual under their own name and not as a member of UBDC.\n      \n    \n   5.  \tMembers who borrow props from UBDC will have to sign them out. If they are not returned by \nthe end of the semester, the member who signed them out will lose borrowing privileges and will have to pay to replace the prop. They will not be permitted to take out another prop until the missing one is recollected or replaced.  Anyone who returns props damaged will have to pay the club for the replacement of pieces or the entire prop.\n\n       6.     UBDC members are expected to be accepting and respectful of all races, ethnicities, religions, \nclasses, gender orientations, and identities.   If a member of UBDC violates our atmosphere of mutual respect in any manner at any time or place, (whether at meetings, events or via social media, etc), they will be notified that their standing will be discussed by the UBDC Board and depending on the severity of the case, they may receive a formal warning or if necessary, may not remain a member of the club.\n\nIn closing, our members uphold the mission of the UMass Belly Dance Club which is to teach and perform the beautiful and ancient art of belly dance at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. UBDC\u2019s goal is to inspire and empower students to celebrate and love their bodies regardless of size, age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or ability; thus raising self esteem and promoting a community of acceptance. UBDC\u2019s passion is to share these goals, values, and talents with the UMass Amherst community. Our goal this year is to have fun dancing together as a belly dance family and community, host great events, and help one another improve dance skills in an inclusive, fun and welcoming environment.  \n\n\nBy signing, I agree to the terms of this contract:\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinted Name: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Signature and Date:\n\n\n\n\nII.

Introduction \n1. About the Bike Coop \nThe UMASS Bike Coop is a student run business that serves the UMASS community.  We offer a convenient, low cost alternative to other area bike shops by providing reasonable prices, quality service, and by maintaining a forum for our Co-Managers to teach both our customers and each other about all aspects of bicycle repair. \n            The Bike Coop has enthusiasm for cycling and the maintenance and repair of bicycles, as well as a great interest in gaining the educational experience achieved through the operation of a successful, student run business.  We incorporate the diverse knowledge and the experience of our Co-Managers, emphasizing that while mechanical expertise is a plus, a strong desire to contribute to our business is our primary criteria.\n            The Bike Coop operates on a payroll based system allowing for our Co-Managers to not only learn but to receive payment for their services.  Each mechanic is responsible for their own work. The UMASS Bike Co-op is an equal opportunity employer.\n            In our efforts to ensure the democratic nature of our organization, we find that the maintenance of an effective formal structure is essential.  This ensures that decisions we reach as a group are effectively implemented with the knowledge and support of all Co-Managers.  For this reason, we are strict about our Co-Managers\u2019 attendance at All-Staff meetings, their familiarity with our goals, and our expectations of professionalism in the performance of all services to the UMASS community.\n        \t\nOn-Shift Duties\n \nTo ensure the success of the Bike Coop in serving the community of UMASS this document should be read in full and updated at the end of every hiring process. As a business each co-manager at the Bike Coop is expected to do the following:\n \n1. Co-manager Responsibilities\nShow up for scheduled shifts and Be punctual!\nContribute at least 3 hours on schedule a week.\nGet someone to cover for you if you are unable to be there!\nBe Professional to Bike Coop Customers\nDon't leave a customer floating: be proactive and ask if they need help.\nHelp the customer or point them towards a solution.\nBe honest about your skill level. If you don\u2019t know how to solve a problem seek help from another co-manager or direct the customer to other resources.\nUnder-promise over-deliver; anticipate the unknown extra charges and quote a higher price. A customer is always happier paying less than expected than more. \nGet your questions answered.\nCommunicate with all Co-Managers of the Coop\n \n2. Mechanic Responsibilities\nSee that the repairs promised get done promptly.\nMaintain a high standard of quality in your work as well as of your fellow Co-Managers\nAsk your fellow Co-Managers for help or to check your work \nAssist New Hires in mechanical operations of the Coop\nHelp them to adjust to the new surroundings and anything they need help with\nNew hires must get their work checked by another co-manager.\n \n3. Training and Overseeing of New Hires:\nThe training committee will organize at least the following training sessions:\nRunning the register and filling out tags\nBasic mechanics: safety checks, fixing flats, adjusting brakes, adjusting derailleurs\nMedium mechanics: Truing wheels, adjusting bearings (headsets, hubs, bottom brackets)\nMechanics are encouraged to make every opportunity to share their knowledge and info with new hires.\nNew hires are encouraged to ask questions and take the initiative to learn the ins and outs of the Bike Coop from the experienced Co-Managers of the Coop.\nAssist New Hires in business operations of the Coop\nHelp them to adjust to the new surroundings and anything they need help with\n\n\n4. Taking Bikes In/ Using Bike Tag\n All Co-Managers are responsible for logging in bikes during their shift.  When a customer brings in a bike, you need to do each of the following: \nCheck the bike over.  Look for loose hubs, headset, BB, missing spokes, worn brake shoes, etc.  \nLet the customer know if the bike needs more than the requested repairs.\nRemove all unattached accessories from the bike (locks, helmets, etc.)\nFill out a tag and fasten the stub to the bike. \nPut the tag in the appropriate slot\n\n5. Customer Complaints\nIf a customer is unsatisfied with the work the Bike Coop has done on his/her bike, follow these 2 steps:\n1. Evaluate the problems they have with the work\n2. If complaint is valid and caused by employee error, redo service at no cost\n \n6. Checking Off Work Done\n It is imperative that all mechanics check off their work for any repairs done.  This is the only way that we can keep track of the work that you\u2019ve done, so check mark and initial next to the job done on the tag. \nIndicate that the work was done, and note any work the customer confirms or denies.\n\n7. Call Back System\nTo allow the Bike Coop to keep the flow of bikes going in and out of the Coop, we must use our call back system. Not only will it help with space problems but with customer service appreciation.\n \nCall customer and inform them politely that their bike has been finished and what the cost will be. Inform them that they need to pick up their bike within 3 days or a late fee of $10/day will be charged.\nWrite down your initials and the date and time you called, in three days call again to inform customer of charges.\n \n8. Working the Register\n We use lavu to track our sales, meaning all sales must be checked out through lavu.\nEnter your pin to log in.\nGo into the labor or parts tab depending on what work is being entered.\nSelect appropriate category, and the appropriate labor or part for the job.\nBOTH THE PART AND LABOR FOR JOB MUST BE INPUTTED!\nOnce the correct amount of parts and work has been entered, select checkout in the top right corner.\nSelect the proper payment method (card, cash, or ucard debit).\nIf paying with cash, first enter the amount of cash they\u2019re giving you (so if it\u2019s a $15 job but they use a $20 bill, enter $20, not $15) and then hit the cash button.\nIf they\u2019re paying with cash, give them the correct change.\nIf they\u2019re paying with a card, hit sale, enter the amount of the purchase, hit enter, and follow the prompts on the screen.\nMake sure the customer signs the receipt if prompted to.\n\n\n\n\n9. Taking in Orders this all need to be redone\n        \tA. Special Orders\n      \tThese are extremely important to our business. If a customer needs a part and we do not physically carry it in our inventory we can accommodate the customer by making a special order.  This function allows us to serve every customer\u2019s parts needs and no customer should leave the shop feeling like they could not get the part from the Bike Coop. When a customer needs a part ordered that is not in inventory the way to do so is as follows:\n            \t1.

Bike Coop\u2019s Formal Structure\n1. All-Staff Meetings\nDay: Thursdays @ 7pm\nAll-staff meetings are mandatory and are held every week.  This is intended to keep all Co-Managers of the Coop abreast of new information and events.  Each week a Co-Manager of the Coop will volunteer to be the note taker and the following week that person will facilitate the meeting.  The meetings have a general structure including the following:\nOpening Go-Around, Dot/Star Report, Consultant Report, BOsB Report, Marketing Report, Purchasing Report, Communication Report, Cash-Out, and any other issues or concerns that develop during the course of the semester.\nAt the beginning of each semester the Consultant needs to schedule meeting locations with the CSB.  These locations must be within the Bike coop or CSB.  No All-Staff can be held outside of these locations. \n \n2. All-Staff Procedure\nBefore every meeting, the Dot/Star Committee/Co-Manager should bring the Dot/Star Spreadsheet, along with the notebook for notes, and this handbook to the meeting.\nNote taker Responsibilities\nRead off Follow Throughs from previous week\u2019s meeting when the Follow Through section is during the meeting  \nRecord any and all Follow Through during the meeting on the agenda document\nRecord each discussion point for each committee\u2019s report and any other issues or discussion affecting the Coop\nEmployees are not allowed any unexcused absences. All absences must have a valid excuse like:\nMedical appointment\nExam\nEmergency\nIf you are REALLY sick\nTHEN UR FIRED\nAll shifts must be attended or covered.  There is no excuse for missing a shift except an emergency.  A missed shift will result in a dot\n\n \n3. Dot Star Policy\n The dot star system allows for coop employees to evaluate the behavior of their co-managers.  It is an opportunity for individuals to speak up about issues and feelings they have, good and bad, with the behavior of fellow employees.  It helps to ensure no one\u2019s hard work goes unnoticed, but also makes sure that individuals are held responsible for their actions.  If a co-manager has done or is doing something that you feel is detrimental to the business you have the responsibility to dot them.  Vice versa, if a co-manager is doing something that you feel is beneficial to the business you may reward them with a star.\n\nDOTS\n The dots received by individuals during the week will be discussed at the next all-staff meeting.  The employee who received the dot(s) will have a chance to appeal at the meeting.  It will then be decided by a group vote if the dot was justifiably given or not.  If the group votes yes, the dot will remain.  If the group votes no, the dot will be taken off the chart. Employees that receive dots have a chance to remove them from their record by earning a star.  Dots will transfer over from the previous semester if they were received in the final month of the semester.  Because stars can remove dots, employees have many opportunities to clean up their record if they choose.  If the dot was received prior to the last month of the semester, it will be erased off the record. Dots should be given for careless, malicious and destructive actions, not honest mistakes.\n \nDot worthy actions include:\nSkipping all-staff without valid reason\nSkipping a shift without valid reason\nFailing to follow through on a FT\nLeaving the shop a mess\nUnproductive during shift\nDisorderly conduct:\nYelling with rage and use of profanity\nDamaging property\nInappropriate behavior \nExploiting or offending customers or co-managers\nImproper or destructive use of the computer\nAny suspicious money handling\nVerbal or physical abuse of co-manager or customer\nStealing any coop property\n \nConsequences upon the accumulation of 5 dots:\nNo personal orders\nMandatory 1 hour, unpaid, not on shift shop clean. One hour of cleaning will erase dot 5, Other four will need stars to replace\nMeeting with HR \n \nUpon the accumulation of 4 dots, the dot-ee will be brought up for termination before the other employees at the next all-staff meeting.  For termination to occur, it must be voted at all staff by a majority of those present.\n \nHalf Dots\nHalf dots are also possible. Doing work not up to standards, calling a customer before work is done, and not filling out a tag completely are examples of half dot worthy offenses. Half dots are for mess ups that don\u2019t quite meet full dot standards, but some disciplinary action is warranted.\n\n\nSTARS\n Stars are awarded to employees who do things that benefit and help the business.  As with dots, stars will be discussed at all-staff meetings to validate their distribution.\n \nStar worth actions include:\nFilling in for someone\nCleaning and organizing the shop\nStarting a new project\nCutting that mullet\nDoing any off shift work for the coop\nFilling in for someone\u2019s follow through\n \n4 stars earns you a large beverage!\n\nVI.

Bike Coop Bookkeeping Procedure\n \nBookkeeping\n-          Should be done once a week (Usually Thursday) and available for review by the consultant. The consultant may also wish to set up a weekly meeting with the bookkeeper to discuss the business. It is required by the CSB that the bookkeeper and consultant meet at least once per month\n-          Bookkeeping consists of recording of the cashouts and purchases of the business on both the computers in the CSB, and in filing related paperwork.\n \nLogging onto Computers at CSB:\nPress control, alt, delete.\nEnter username and password\nUsername: bikecoopcm1-sa or bikecoopcm2-sa\nPassword: Helmets4@LL!!\n \nQuickBooks: dic\n1.      Using QuickBooks comes with training and everyone with training who uses QuickBooks must have signature responsibility.\n2.      QuickBooks is where all the Bike Coop\u2019s records of accounts are stored; all money spent and earned is logged in QuickBooks. Those include: purchases, daily cash outs and weekly payrolls. Anyone who is going to be on purchasing, payroll, or bookkeeping committee must learn how to enter their given information into QuickBooks.\n3.      QuickBooks is the nucleus of bookkeeping and money tracking in the Bike Coop, neglecting your duties for QuickBooks is a five dot offense.\n \nLogging into QuickBooks:\n1.  \tGo back into the bike coop folder and hit quickbooks. Log into it.\nUsername: QBEBike\nPassword: $bikeQ4\n \n Entering Data on QuickBooks:\n1.  \tFrom the main page of QuickBooks you must go to the \u201cgeneral ledger\u201d to get there go to \u201cLists\u201d on the menu bar, pick the first thing under \u201cLists\u201d (Chart of Accounts\u201d) and from there select \u201cGeneral Ledger\u201d (7th one down).\n2.  \tNow you get to enter data into QuickBooks! There are three different things we as the Bike Coop enter into QuickBooks: Payroll, Cash outs, and Pro-Card orders.\n \n \nC. Cash out:\n\tDaily Cashout Duties: Cashout Committee:\n \nCashout involves counting the money from the register at the end of the day; comparing the Z tape to the transaction tape and actual money in till (Drawer) and logging it in the cashout form; leaving $100 for the next day\u2019s operations; filling a deposit slip for the bank.\n   \nCount the total amount of money in the register: it should equal the amount of money in transactions since the last cashout + $50.  If this is not the case, you have a discrepancy.  \n If you find a discrepancy of $20 or more, it has to be filed with the Center for Student Business with an \u201cOver/Short\u201d form. \n\nTo deposit at the bank, bring the cash bag if you feel compelled to present yourself as a mark) to the bursar\u2019s office window.\n\nStep 1: Counting the Cash in the Register\nAfter closing, print out z tapes from credit card machine and lavu.\nLavu: log into lavu, hit lavu button (top left corner), hit manager options, and then print z tape.\nCredit Card Machine: hit other, close batch.\nBring up cash out sheet template. This is located in google drive in the cash out folder.\nMake a copy of the cash out sheet template (File>Make a copy) and rename it as the date that you are depositing for. Put this into the correct year and month folder for organization.\nFill out how many bills you have in this cash out form. You want to put the amount of money you have in bills rather than the number of bills. For example, if you have 4 $20 bills, you would input $80, not 4. Do this for all bills and coins.\nFill out the rest of the sheet.\nSeparate $100 out of the total cash in the register. The register must always have $100 in it. You only deposit what is left after the $100 is taken out.\n\nTo Get Ready to Deposit:\nGo to the CSB with the money that you are going to deposit. Log into one of the computers with the bike coop login.\nUsername: bikecoopcm1-sa OR bikecoopcm2-sa\nPassword: Helmets4@LL!!\nGo into the directory (if it isn\u2019t already open, click start in the bottom left corner of your window and click documents). From here click on pubdir on the left side menu. Next hit All Business Files, and then Bike Coop. Next go into the cash out folder. From here there will be a document called Deposit Form Template (or something of that nature). Open this up.\nThe deposit form should look like the picture on the right. The highlighted areas are where you will be inputting information. Put in Bike Coop under group name and your name under depositor. Next, input your bills into the section on the top right hand side. This is just like the cash out sheet from before, except you are only inputting the bills that you will depositing. Again, put in the amount, not the number of bills (if you have 4 $20 bills, you would input $80, not 4). Into description put the date that the money was earned, not the date that you plan to deposit it (if this is the cash out for 2/27, put 2/27/20xx, even if you do it on 3/2). On the very bottom on the left side there is a large blank space. Here you put your name, email, and phone number. This is so you can be contacted if there is an issue with the deposit. \nThe speed type, account, and dept id should already be saved into the document. The amount section will automatically tally up the amounts from when you inputted the bills.\nHow to do credit cards will be put in when figured out lol.\nNext, SAVE AS the file. This makes a new copy with the information you just put in without getting rid of the template. Put this file into the correct folder corresponding with the year you are depositing for as well as the month.\nNow, print out 3 copies to the CSB printers. Also go into the google drive and print out 1 copy of the cash out sheet. \nStaple the cash out sheet, 1 of the deposit sheets, and all of the z tapes together. These will be stored in the bike coop filing cabinet.\nBefore you file the stapled cash out stuff away, do Quickbooks and sales tracking.\n\nQuickbooks:\nGo back into the bike coop folder and hit quickbooks. Log into it.\nUsername: QBEBike\nPassword: $bikeQ4\nHit the chart of accounts button, general ledger, and make the window big. At the bottom of the window is where you input all of the information. \nIn number, put your initials. In payee, put the name of what you are inputting (ie cash, credit card, ucard, etc). In account, it depends on what entry you are putting in. It is all under the revenue category, but if you are doing the cash, it will be revenue: cash, and so on for credit card and ucard. Under increase put the amount of that earned. The date should be the date that the revenue was earned, not the date you are entering it into quickbooks. When you want to submit the entry, hit the record button.\nCash, credit card, and ucard all get their own entry, so if you have purchases using all of them, you will have 3 entries.\nNow you can exit out of quickbooks and do sales tracking!\n\nSales Tracking:\nGo back into the cashout folder. Hit the current sales tracking.\nInside, go to the first tab. The columns have what you need to input. Make sure you are inputting it into the correct date. Basically put in what lavu says you made for credit card, ucard, cash, etc and then what you actually counted. \nOn the second tab, it shows an overview. Here, if there is a discrepancy, there is a column where you put why that happened. There is also a column where you can put comments (ie it was a snow day or whatever). \nSave the document!\n\nNow that you\u2019re done in the CSB, put the stapled packet into the correct drawer (in the correct month/year) to file.\n\nNow the Actual Depositing:\nPut the money you are depositing in your money bag with 2 copies of the deposit form. Take this to the bursar\u2019s office window (located in whitmore. It\u2019s on the second floor, and on the directory in the entryway to whitmore it should give you the exact room number).\nGive the teller the deposit form and your cash. Now you\u2019re done!\n\nPCI Inspection Log\n-This is basically just checking the credit card terminal every day to make sure there aren\u2019t any skimmers, tool markings, and that the terminal we have is the terminal we\u2019re supposed to have. \nFind folder in drive for PCI inspection log. There\u2019s one separately in the drive and one in the cash out folder, but they\u2019re the same so it doesn\u2019t matter which one you use.\nMake a copy of the template that\u2019s in there. Rename it to the date, and put it in the folder that corresponds to the correct month and year.\nFill the form out. Make sure you do this every day so we will be PCI compliant!\n\nA Few Notes:\nMake sure that cash isn\u2019t left in the register overnight. Put the cash that stays in the register (the $100) into a separate money bag so you don\u2019t mix the $100 with the money to deposit, and bring it to the business center for overnight safekeeping. The person who has the opening shift the next day will get it from the business center and put the $100 back into the register. \nMake sure that all of the z tapes and printed out every day. If you can\u2019t do it for some reason and nobody on cash out can do it, ask the person who closes to print them out and put all of the money in the register in the safe, that way you get the daily reports and can count register money the next day. \n\nBookkeeping:\n\n1.  \tYou will need to get all the information from the Cashout forms located in the CSB conference room (where we have allstaff) in the BikeCooop drawer (over in the left hand side of the corner).\n2.  \tFor each Cashout sheet you will enter the total CASH earned per day and the total UCARD DEBIT earned per day.\n3.  \tTo enter in the cash earned: in the \u201cDate\u201d column enter the date of the Cashout for which you are entering, in the \u201cType\u201d column put your initials, in the \u201cPayee\u201d row select \u201cCash\u201d in the \u201cIncrease\u201d row enter what the Cashout sheet says (NOT THE Z-TAPE). The total can be found under \u201cTotal\u201d on the right hand side of the Cashout Sheet, finally in the \u201cAccount\u201d Column (under \u201cPayee\u201d column on the right) select \u201cCASH\u201d and hit \u201crecord\u201d (located on the lower right hand side of QuickBooks)\n4.  \tFor entering ucard debit you need to look at the Z-tape under the S&V section, the total in the S&V section is the number you inter into QuickBooks. To do this you first put the date of the day you are recording under the :Date: column, put your initials under the \u201cType\u201d column, in the \u201cPayee\u201d column select \u201cUCard Revenue\u201d enter the total money earned that day (S&V total on Z-tape) in the \u201cIncreasing\u201d column and finally in the \u201cAccount\u201d column (under and to the right of \u201cPayee\u201d column) select \u201cUCARD\u201d then hit record (lower right hand side of QuickBooks).\n5.  \tThen you are done entering in the data from that day.

Inventory Procedure\n \nSo, a little overview: Inventory is taken:\n\u00b7         The last business day of every month. Business consultants have been emphasizing that inventory is submitted by the first day of the following month.. Ie. Inventory for September is due October 1st.\n\u00b7         The last business day of the term.\nThis is a minor position should you choose to accept it.\n \nStep 1: If a google spreadsheet is not created for the term already, you have to make it.  Look at past examples. It is set up like so (but in an excel spreadsheet of course):\n\nAnd such is the set up of the spread sheet. There also needs to be a formula that totals everything in columns \u201cE\u201d / product of the quantity and wholesale price. So this tells whoever reads the inventory how many dollars worth of parts are in the shop. Make tabs on the document for the oncoming months of the term, filled with same template.\n \nStep 3: On the correct date, the person doing inventory goes onto the computer and pulls up the tab for the correct month and prints it out.\nStep 4: Said person goes around the shop and fills in the quantity correlating to the correct category. If there are any parts that are not already on the inventory sheet, write them in.\nStep 5: IF, there are parts that were not on the sheet in stock, add some columns under the appropriate category and write in a description of the item and look up the wholesale price. Then copy this spread sheet onto the next coming months of the term. You don\u2019t need to do anything in this step if the all the parts in stock are on the inventory sheet.\nStep 6: Fill in the correct quantity next to the correct item.\nStep 7: Save file.\nStep 8: Send file to your business consultant.\n \n\nG.

HR Committee\n\nA. Overview\nThe HR committee shall consist of 3 elected members who serve for two semesters at a time before elections are held again. The HR committee shall be responsible for handling interpersonal conflicts between co-managers at the Bike Coop that the co-managers are uncomfortable with bringing up at All Staff. The HR committee will also be responsible for meeting with underperforming co-managers who have received 5 or more dots over the period of one semester. \n\nB. Elections\nAt the end of Spring semester of each year, elections will be held to determine the members of the HR committee for the next two semesters. In order to be put on the ballot, a person must first be nominated by another co-manager, the nomination must be seconded by a third co-manager, and then the nomination must be approved by a majority vote of the co-managers. Once all nominations have been put in and approved or disapproved, a vote will be held in which each co-manager may cast two votes and those three candidates with the greatest number of votes will serve as the members of the HR committee for the following two semesters.\n\nC. Responsibilities\nThe primary responsibility of the members of HR committee is to create an atmosphere in the Coop in which people feel safe and secure in addressing their grievances both with other co-managers and with the Coop culture. \nIf a co-manager approaches a member of the HR committee with an issue, it is the responsibility of that member to handle in a way that both addresses the co-managers concerns and prevents unnecessary conflict. Members of the HR committee should respect co-managers requests for anonymity regardless of the situation as respecting the wishes of your fellow co-managers and making them feel comfortable is part of the primary responsibility of the HR committee. \nIn the event where a co-manager has a grievance with another co-manager that they wish to have addressed, the member of the HR committee is responsible for arranging a mediation between the co-managers to come to an amicable conclusion. \nMembers of the HR committee also have the responsibility to inform co-managers about complaints about them if the complainant wishes their complaint to be known. \nIf issues arise among comanagers and two or less HR committee members, the remaining HR member/s should be approached with the issue. If the issue(s) regards all three members of HR, it shall be brought up at all staff or in some context outside of HR. \n\nD. Firing\nMembers of the HR committee are responsible for meeting with co-managers who have accumulated 5 or more dots in one semester at the Coop to inform them of their status and also discuss the issues addressed in the dots. In this case the members of the HR committee are responsible for informing the co-manager that they are in a probationary period in which they may not earn any more dots. If the co-manager receives another dot during this time, they are brought up for termination at the next All Staff and if a majority of fellow co-managers approve their termination then they are fired. \nMembers of the HR committee also have discretion and responsibility in regards to co-managers whose behavior they believe is so detrimental to the Coop they cannot work there any longer. In the event where a co-manager engages in serious misconduct (assault, theft, etc.) and the HR committee is made aware of the misconduct, the co-manager will immediately be met with by the committee and based on the meeting, brought up for termination at the following All Staff. \n\n\n VIII. Conclusion\nA. Group Decision-Making\nIt is the ideology of the Bike Coop to make significant decisions collectively, in a Democratic manner.  This process ensures that each Co-Manager has a voice in the Coop and that no one person has more power than another. Responsibilities at the Bike Coop have tended to accumulate on a few of the managers, resulting in some burn out. Be sure to help out as much as you can.\n            It is important for all of the Coop's Co-Managers to remember that anyone can serve on any committee or help to facilitate a meeting.  The only people who likely have the legitimate power to sway a group's decision are those who have been with the Coop for a semester or longer, and their experience and knowledge of how the Coop is run will lead them to their decisions and assumed leadership.  There is currently no formal quantification of such a person's legitimate power in influencing group decisions-- this tends to amount to the extent that a person's knowledge and voice is known and respected within the group.\nAll committees should report to the Coop routinely at weekly All-Staff meetings.  This is an important \"checks and balances\" device, to ensure that the committees are performing their functions to the satisfaction of the group as a whole.\n \nWe hope you enjoy your time here as a member of the Bike Coop.\n \n \n "}]}, {"Name": "Biochemistry Club", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name":

Name and Office\nThe name of the organization shall be \u201cThe BOLTWOOD ProjectTM\u201d.\n\nThe principal office of the organization (mailbox) shall be the Student Activities Office in the Student Union of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The mailing address of the organization shall be: Box 45, Student Activities Office, Student Union, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, M.A. 01003. \n\nFor further information or questions regarding the academic service-learning program, the primary contact is: Ellen Correa at 140 Hicks Way, Goodell Building, Room 611, University of Massachusetts Amherst, M.A. 01003-9272.\n\nII. Purposes\nThe first aim of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is to augment efforts of: the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services contracted Group Homes (i.e. Intermediate Care Facilities); the Farren Care Center of Montague/Turners Falls; the community service programs for the developmentally challenged sponsored by the Town of Amherst Leisure Services and Supplemental Education department at the Bangs Community Center; several school systems in Amherst and the surrounding areas; and The Berkshire Hills Music Academy (serving Williams Syndrome adolescents) of South Hadley - in providing care and habilitation to stimulate individuals who are developmentally delayed, cognitively impaired, mentally ill, emotionally troubled or physically challenged, as well as children of displaced families. The program is geared to serve as many residents/attendees of the participating community or facility in their efforts to participate in life in the greater community and to contribute to their efforts to build a satisfactory and useful life in a participating facility for those not able to leave the confines of said facility. \n\nThe second aim of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is to act as allies with the Participant population to acquaint as many people (i.e. our student population) as possible, with those aspects of developmental disabilities, cognitively impaired, psychiatric/emotionally ill and homelessness - that are too frequently overlooked in our society. These aspects include the positive possibilities of community connections and normalization, as well as the negative effects of institutionalization with a particular emphasis placed on the need for comprehensive social education and integration wherever possible.\n\nThe third aim of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is to expand its role into the community for community-based, community-serving programs and as a means of expressing the needs of a large segment of the community\u2019s own population. Additionally, The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM hopes to promote a system of reciprocity between the community and the participating groups and facilities.\n\nThe fourth aim of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is to provide students with opportunities to exercise their capabilities and expertise in the areas of their own chosen professions. While this goal also serves as an easy recruitment process for careers in the field of Human Services, it is hoped that the diversity of the individual BOLTWOOD programs will provide adequate experience for persons contemplating any of a range of professional vocations.\n\nThe fifth aim of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is to serve as a guide or model for other community-minded student education/service projects, especially those in the areas of community health and social welfare.\n\nThe sixth aim of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is to raise additional funds, to supplement SGA funding, for the development and implementations of programs that are in furtherance of the above stated goals. People that may be included within these programs can be any student, facility or persons that may want to participate. This does not disqualify those who are not Participants, Volunteers, Supervisors or Coordinators (see section \u201cV. Officers\u201d) but includes those who want to be part of an all-inclusive environment. Activities may include but not limited to hay rides, trips to the mall, bowling, Yankee Candle, etc.. \u00a0\n\nIII. Membership\nThe BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is a service-learning organization. \u201cMembership\u201d in the organization shall consist of any students interested in carrying out the stated purposes of the organization, shall be members of the greater Five College Community or simply students from UMass Amherst who are accepted into The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM. \nThere are two different sections of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM.\nFirst section consists of a course. The student must participate in the \u201cRecruitment Night,\u201d and in order to participate must be selected by one of the supervisors based on their leadership experience and time commitment. These students are enrolled in SRVCLRNG 390B and earn two credits per semester for the learning they do through their site work, weekly reflections, and participation in three Saturday seminars.\nSecond section is less of a time commitment and consists of any student who is interested in spreading awareness of disabilities. The activities of this section include hosting and attending different disability workshops and events. Students in this section may elect, as a group or individually, to participate in volunteer opportunities in the surrounding communities separately from students in SRVCLRNG 390B.\n\n\nIV. Affiliation\nThe BOLTWOOD ProjectTM draws its greatest support, financial and personal, from the students and student organizations of the Five College Community, but more commonly from the University of Massachusetts. The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM agrees to abide by the rules and regulations of those institutions in regard to recruitment, fundraising and administration in exchange for their continued support of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM.\n\nThe BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) of the University of Massachusetts and agrees to comply with all regulations governing RSO groups.\n\nWith regards to The BOLTWOOD Project\u2019s program with the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services, Boltwood must conform with the Department of Mental Health of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u2019 rules and regulations regarding personal rights. BOLTWOOD programs must conform to service programs prescribed by law for its client population because the contracted group homes are the designated lawful service delivery agent for that client population. The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM may utilize students from any or all of the Five Colleges to participate and administer the BOLTWOOD volunteer programs. On May 7, 1978, the Government Affairs Committee gave The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM an exception to Chapter 9, Paragraph 3 SGA By-Laws. The student interns designated as BOLTWOOD Supervisors, and their activities, will be coordinated by the three BOLTWOOD Student Coordinators and the Faculty Director. The BOLTWOOD \u201cSupervisors,\u201d under the guidance of the Coordinators and Faculty Director, will develop, administer and staff the educational, social and recreational programs utilizing the services of BOLTWOOD \u201cVolunteers.\u201d Note: In September of 1990, the funding for paid part-time interns at the Belchertown State School was dropped. No longer are ANY members of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM paid for their participation or services.\n\nThe BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is associated with an academic service-learning program under the Office of Civic Engagement & Service-Learning (CESL) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Through CESL, The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM provides an enriched recreation and social environment for adults and children with varying intellectual and physical abilities. The program offers a 2-credit seminar for students who are part of the team that organizes weekly engaging activities. In addition, a 4-credit leadership course is offered for students who have completed exceptional service work in the seminar and are selected as team supervisors. Through seminar and classroom activities, and through the weekly sessions at a variety of service provider sites, students develop a deepened understanding of the challenges, opportunities and complex lives of people with disabilities. \n\n\nV. Officers\nThe governing body of The BOLTWOOD ProjectTM is the Executive Board (i.e. the three Student Co-Coordinators, the Faculty Director and Club Advisor). The \u201cSupervisors\u201d are part of the \u201cAdministrative Team\u201d and are selected on a semester-to-semester basis by the Executive Board from applications received from current or former \u201cVolunteer.\u201d Each \u201cSupervisor\u201d is responsible for a group of \u201cVolunteers\u201d with the selection of \u201cVolunteers\u201d previously described in Section III - Membership. Generally, the turnover of \u201cSupervisors\u201d is based upon attrition through graduation. In summary, the Supervisors are interviewed by the Coordinators and selected from those who previously were successful \u201cVolunteers\u201d (i.e. members) and who have applied for any open Supervisor positions. Supervisors are replaced as they graduate, leave for study abroad, transfer out of UMass or are deemed unsuccessful as a Supervisor by the Executive Board the previous or current semester. \n\nThe top three officers of the organization making up the Executive Board shall include three \u201cStudent Coordinators\u201d (Vice President/Treasurer/Secretary). When the time comes for new Executive Board officers, the current Executive Board Members will recommend students for the new (potential) Executive Board officers. The new Executive Board officers will come from those having served or who are currently serving as \u201cSupervisors\u201d within the program. Each potential Executive Board officer will fill out and turn in a Student Coordinator Application for review. \n\nThe Faculty Director, in conjunction with the out-going Student Coordinator(s), shall choose the New Student Coordinators from among the current \u201cSupervisor\u201d applicants. In summary, the new Coordinator(s) are interviewed and recommended by the Executive Board for those positions as the current Coordinator(s) are about to graduate, transfer, take a semester studying abroad or do not meet the responsibilities as deemed by the Executive Board. \n\nThe Administrative Team and Executive Board shall approve the list of \u201cVolunteers\u201d from their recruitment efforts at the beginning of each semester.\n\nFor any and all students, in the class and/or in the club, shall have the opportunity to consult with the Club Advisor. The Club Advisor is there as a resource for Club Members, Volunteers, Supervisors and Coordinators to go on a need-be basis. \n\nVI.

A valid form of identification is required for entry e.g. driver\u2019s license, FID, passport, etc.\nTransportation to the Westover Air Reserve Base is coordinated through two different platforms: a social media page specifically dedicated for sparring interest and activity, and a group texting system. \nGroup texts are not sent to everyone. Members must speak to the Communications Officer or Team Captain and express interest in sparring in order to be added.\nMembers in possession of a vehicle are highly encouraged to offer transportation and communicate availability through either medium or by contacting the Communications officer.\nAll trips to the Westover Air Reserve Base must be coordinated with the coach Rocky Snow.\nAccess to the Westover Air Reserve Base is prohibited without an escort from Coach Rocky Snow.\n\nEmergency Procedures\nContact the fitness center hotline (413-577-3958) to speak to the health and safety coordinator.\nFollow emergency protocol and assist with any paperwork if necessary. \nIn the case of minor injuries, apply first aid. Call 911 immediately if the injury is severe.\n\nRecreation Center\nGeneral Medical Emergency Protocol\nIf a participant is fully conscious and experiencing symptoms of low or high blood sugar, you may offer 1) glucose tablets or 2) peanut butter crackers and apple juice. It is advised to ask if they have diabetes, when was the last time they had eaten and/or if they have any food allergies. Do not hesitate to call 911 if you suspect the incident is serious or if you are unsure.\nIf someone is diabetic, they will likely be okay with taking glucose tablets and are aware of the positive impact of the glucose tablets. Please ask the participant in question if he/she is diabetic.\nIf the participant is uncomfortable taking a glucose tablet, please inform him/her that Campus Recreation has peanut butter crackers and apple juice available and ask if they would like this. Please ask if they have any allergies limiting them to taking the peanut butter crackers or apple juice.\nIf the condition of the participant does not improve upon providing peanut butter crackers/apple juice/glucose tablets, please call 911 for advanced care.\nAny medical issue is a potential emergency for the individual. Do not hesitate to call 911 if you suspect that the incident is serious or that you are unsure.\nSymptoms of low blood sugar include: confusion, dizziness, feeling shaky, hunger, headaches, irritability, weakness and anxiety. People with or without diabetes can experience low sugar symptoms.\nEssentially, symptoms for individuals with low blood sugar levels and individuals with high blood sugar levels are very similar. It has been communicated that we treat both as low blood sugar levels. Low blood sugar levels come on quick and we can fix it quick. This is the same approach used by EMTs and first responders as the application of sugar to someone with high blood sugar symptoms will not have adverse effects.\n\nDecontamination of blood spills (Recreation Center Protocol) \nFor a large spill contact Environmental Health and Safety for assistance.\nTreat all human blood and human body fluids as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, or other blood borne pathogens. Always wear protective gloves when treating any blood spills or injuries involving blood, bodily fluids, non-intact skin & mucous membranes (i.e. nose, eyes, and mouth).\nLocate the nearest blood spill kit. Blood spill kits at the recreation center can be found at the following locations: Laundry 108A, Storage 118A, Storage 121A, Storage 210B, Storage 214C, Storage 215A and Storage 310B \nAll contaminated items must be placed in the red biohazard waste bag(s). The Biohazard waste bag is available within the blood spill kit.\nUpon completion of the spill cleanup, the red biohazard waste bag must be disposed of properly in the 33 gallon red biohazard container located in Laundry 108. After placing the items in the biohazard container, please make sure the cover to the container is secure.\nPlease inform Roger Heimerman (413-577-3868) if the 33 gallon biohazard container is nearing full capacity. A service request will be placed with the EH&S to have the contents picked up and disposed of by environmental health agency.\nWash your hands immediately with soap and running water after treating any injury, including situations where gloves are worn. If running water is not available, use antiseptic wipes until you are able to wash your hands with soap and water. \nIf gloves are not immediately available during an emergency, it is highly recommended to create a large barrier between the blood and your hands. A bulky cloth or towel may be used until proper medical materials arrive. DO NOT USE BARE HANDS!\nAnyone with a soiled shirt or workout gear must discontinue participation. Do not force someone to remove something they don\u2019t want to, but the participant must be informed they cannot continue to participate in soiled clothing. If they choose to remove their soiled clothing, ask them if they want to keep it. If not, dispose of it with the rest if the clean-up materials. If they want to keep it, put the clothing in a biohazard bag for them to take with them.\nAll open wounds must be covered.\nBlood spill kits contain the following: cloth towels, paper towels, red biohazard waste bags, multi-use disinfectant spray, protective gloves, goggles, forceps, small dustpan and broom, and surgical mask.\nIn case of major injury,, immediately notify building supervisor,  Safety officers are to follow safety procedures explained below:\nEmergency services are to be called 9-1-1, CPR/AED if unresponsive and/or a possible cardiac emergency.\nIf a participant receives a significant blow to the head\nGently allow participant to lie or sit on the floor\nWatch for signs of concussion such as:\nSlurred speech\nLack of muscle coordination \nConfusion\nHeadache \nIf symptoms are evident direct to UHS and or the nearest hospital\nComplete accident/injury report, if possible assist rec center with their accident report, verify that the CSD advisor is aware of the accident/ injury and await necessary follow up instructions or actions.\nAll accidents and injuries involving bodily fluids must be cleaned as soon and as safely as possible:\nSpray contaminated surfaces with disinfectant \nApply pressure\nWipe surfaces with towels\nProperly dispose of contaminated towels\n\nBoyden Gym\nContact Dan Markowski of Boyden Gym (413-545-0075) for health and safety information.\nFollow emergency protocol and assist with any paperwork if necessary. \nIn the case of minor injuries, apply first aid. Call 911 immediately if the injury is severe.\n\nThe Coach\n\n\n\nCandidate Criteria\nMeets the USA Boxing certification stated below: \nBe a registered non-athlete for USA Boxing.\nHave a cleared criminal background check, renewed every two years.\nRe-register as a boxing official every year.\nHold necessary coach certification from USA Boxing\nA minimum of ten years of experience with the sport, either as a competitor or as a boxing official.\nMeets the UMass athletic department/recreation sports coaching guidelines:\nThe coach is only responsible for coaching and refrains from involvement in the clubs management.\nClear and evident commitment to ensuring good sportsmanship at all times.\nSafety certifications:\nCPR/First Aid/AED\n\nResponsibilities\nIt is mandatory for the coach to attend all sparring practices, bouts, and tournaments.\nSafety requirements:\nMust be in communication with the director of the facility for which the activity occurs in case of an injury.\nReport all incidents to USA Boxing such as knockouts and/or concussions occurring during training or sparring.\nAct as a referee ensuring that:\nRules and fair play are strictly upheld.\nSparring is conducted in a controlled fashion by offering professional advice and controlling the pace of sparring sessions appropriately.\nBoth boxers do not receive unnecessary and excessive blows while sparring.\nThe bout is terminated in the event that the team member is showing signs of injury or confusion, or displays an inability to protect themselves.\nClear communication is expressed by using key commands:\nStop - when ordering boxers to stop boxing.\nBox - when ordering them to continue.\nBreak - when breaking a clinch, upon which each boxer shall step back before continuing to box.\n\nEmergency Responsibilities\nIn the event of an injury during a club practice at the respective practice facility, the coach must do the following:\nFirst secure the scene while notifying the building supervisor (contact 9-1-1 if a serious or life-threatening injury has occurred, then coordinate with safety officers and the building supervisor).\nFollow the procedures outlined in Article VII: Safety and Liability, Safety Guidelines; then immediately complete an accident/ injury incident report\n\nCurrent Coach\nStephen \u201cRocky\u201d Snow is a Vietnam veteran who has put in over 17,000 hours of volunteer work for the U.S. Veterans Administration and currently serves at the Westover Air Reserve Base.

In order to compete, each fighter has to register with USA Boxing.\n\nDisqualifying Conditions \nAcute and chronic infections including those conditions, but not limited to fever, chest infection, untreated tuberculosis, intestinal infection with potential dehydration/malabsorption, hepatitis, open infected skin lesions (including H. Simplex, MRSA, impetigo, untreated fungal infections, etc.), mononucleosis within the past month, etc. \nSevere blood dyscrasias and clotting disorders which include therapeutic anticoagulation. \nSickle cell disease.\nHistory of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or HIV infection.\nRefractive (Lasik) and intraocular surgery, cataract, retinal detachment.\nMyopia of more than -\u00ad\u20103.50 diopters in one or both eyes.\nRecorded visual acuity in one or both eyes of: uncorrected worse than 20/200; corrected worse than 20/60.\nSignificant congenital or acquired cardiovascular and pulmonary abnormalities including, but not limited to, severe COPD, uncontrolled asthma with potential for hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, severe aortic or pulmonary stenosis, myocarditis or pericarditis, recent embolic disease, 3rd degree heart block, atrial or ventricular tachycardia, contraction of the aorta, unclosed significant patent ductus arteriosus, aortic aneurysm and any of these conditions that have undergone corrective surgery or ablation unless specifically released by a cardiothoracic physician to return to contact/combat sports. Resting BP over 160/100 is considered uncontrolled and a disqualification; however, if the resting BP is over 140/90, the boxer may participate if previous recorded blood pressures have been controlled. Any boxer with persistent BP over 135/85 should be recommended for follow-\u00ad\u2010up with their own personal physician.\nSignificant congenital or acquired musculoskeletal deficiencies including, but not limited to, spinal fractures, spondylolysis, atlantoaxial instability, and the following conditions if they inhibit the boxer\u2019s defense, balance or ability to use the authorized headgear/gloves: loss of thumb or great toe, unstable/subluxing joints\nUnresolved post-\u00ad\u2010concussion symptoms, which will need clearance from a qualified licensed physician \nSignificant neuropsychiatric disturbances or drug abuse \nSignificant congenital or acquired intracranial mass lesions or bleeding, (benign smaller CNS lesions require the clearance by a neurologist or neurosurgeon regarding participation in a contact/combat sport), history of craniotomy, cerebral palsy or hypoxic brain injuries, significant neuropathies which affect balance, sensation, and ability to provide adequate defense \nAny seizure activity within the last 3 years \nHepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites\nPregnancy \nUncontrolled diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled thyroid disease\nAny implantable device which can alter any physiologic process or enhance performance\nWomen\u2019s breast protector which protects anything other than the breast protuberance itself \n\nConditions that are not disqualifying to box:\nDeafness (but coach and trainers must be made aware and the coach and or trainer may tap the deaf boxer on the shoulder if necessary to signal \u201cbreak\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d) \nBoxers with dental braces or other orthodontic appliances as long as there is permission to compete with braces or orthodontic appliances form attached to the boxer\u2019s passbook. Note that this includes the newer permanent retainers in use. \nBoxers with non\u2010incarcerated hernias or absence of one testicle or an undescended testicle may participate as long as a protective cup is in use at all times (competition and training). \nBoxers with breast implants may participate as long as there is a Permission to Box with Breast Implants form attached to her passbook. \nSex reassignment (in accordance with IOC regulations): Any \u201cindividuals undergoing sex reassignment of male to female before puberty should be regarded as girls and women\u201d (female). This also applies to individuals undergoing female to male reassignment, who should be regarded as boys and men (male). \n\nEmergency Protocol\nCoach and or trainer administers first aid if a boxer sustains a serious injury or loses consciousness until the boxer can be turned over to the emergency medical treatment.\nSecondary safety officer is to Immediately notify recreation center staff\nDetailed documentation by a trainer and provide to recreation center director.\nFor \u201cdown boxers\u201d:\nExercise cervical precautions.\nMake sure the boxer has an adequate airway.\nRemove the mouthpiece.\nAssess breathing. \nWatch for vomiting or aspiration. \nKeep the boxer down until fully reactive, then permit him to sit up. \nWhen stable, the boxer may be escorted to the corner.\nFor boxers who need to be transported to the hospital:\nSignal the Emergency Personnel on site or call for an ambulance as soon as possible.

Signal/call for the EMT\u2019s and their stretcher/backboard and their rigid cervical collar and let them take over the transfer. \nIf at all possible, aim for a 3 minute evaluation and a 2 minute removal from the ring and or area. As this is only a guideline, safety will not be sacrificed for speed. \nThe boxer has adequate access to oxygen.\nIf the boxer is being transferred by a different means, communicate with them by phone or written instructions. Be sure boxer is accompanied by reliable person, such that can be in contact with the boxer and the family of the boxer.\n\nPotential Boxing Injuries: Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nEvaluating Concussions\nA boxer temporarily stunned or knocked down and unconscious is a stricken boxer and a medical emergency. This indicates that a concussion has occurred\nA concussion is a temporarily altered state of motor hypotonus, helplessness and disturbed consciousness. \nThis includes:\nDisorientation \nMemory deficit \u2013 antegrade and retrograde amnesia \nAltered or slow speech\nDifficulty processing new information\nImpaired motor function \u2013 slow, uncoordinated\nConcussion questionnaire. Note speech \u2013 altered, slow or repetitive?\nWhat is your name?\nWhere are you?\nWhat day and year is it?\nWhat is your opponent\u2019s name? What round is it? \nAsk the boxer to repeat three words after 5 minutes.\nObserve the eyes\nPupils equal, round, reactive?\nIs there spontaneous nystagmus? The presence of spontaneous horizontal nystagmus indicates that the boxer is very vulnerable and should definitely not be permitted to continue. \nLook for facial weakness, hemiparesis or other focal signs. \nThe match should be stopped if the boxer:\nwas clearly stunned\nWas unconscious \nFails to answer the questions correctly\nFails to perform the motor tests \nShows any abnormal focal signs\n\nAbrasions\nSuch injuries often occur to the face and skull and elsewhere. \nBleeding should be halted by pressure, then cleaned and a local antiseptic applied. \n\nLacerations\nThe basic principle of handling cuts around the eye is that, if a cut causes enough bleeding to impair vision, the bout should be stopped. Most cuts will NOT require that the bout be stopped.\nDangerous Cuts:\nCuts over the supraorbital nerve or the supratrochlear nerve, if they are deep enough, may damage the nerve. \nCuts medially over the lacrimal duct area may extend into the naso-lacrimal duct. \nCuts over the infraorbital nerve, if deep enough, could damage the nerve. \nCuts on the eyelid itself could damage the tarsal plate or the globe itself may have been injured. \nVertical cuts through the vermillion border of the lip should stop the bout because of the potential for further tearing of the lip from subsequent trauma. \nCuts around or on the bridge of the nose must be carefully checked for evidence of a compound nasal fracture. If no fracture is present, the bout may be allowed to continue.\nNo dressing of cuts is allowed except for collodion or steri-\u00ad\u2010strips\n\nAddressing Nosebleeds\nThe initial evaluation should determine the presence of a fracture. Gentle handling of a nosebleed is necessary so as not to further aggravate or compound a fracture. \nIf no fracture is felt, the physician must then evaluate the character of the bleeding (i.e. venous vs. brisk arterial gushing). Bouts are stopped for arterial bleeding (rare in this situation). \n(look up how to stop a nosebleed)\nDetermination of posterior bleeding should also be done by tongue depression and pen light observation. If there are clots in the posterior pharynx or the boxer is spitting clots, the bout should be stopped. \nMassive venous bleeding may be cause to stop a bout. \nNosebleeds should stop bouts for medical reasons. \n\n\u201cBlack eye\u201d\nCold applications and light compression limit the extravasation of blood. \n\nHand fracture\nCommon fractures are those of the first metacarpal. They are primarily caused by a poor punching technique, where the thumb is not correctly positioned opposite to the index and middle fingers.\nIndicated by localized tenderness, bruising or swelling\nAll suspected hand and wrist fractures should be splinted and sent for X-\u00ad\u2010ray.\nSuspected dislocations are handled in the same fashion\n\nShoulder Dislocations\nBest relocated immediately before spasm sets in\nA sling with swathe is of benefit, but the boxer needs referral when he returns home. \n\nAbdominal Injuries\nRuptures of the organs in the abdomen (spleen, liver) are uncommon.\nPancreatitis is a remote possibility.\nKidney Contusions\nContusions may lead to massive hematuria even when no anatomic defect appears. \nPain in the abdomen and/or shoulder may signify bleeding. \n\nResponsibilities and Duties \nBoxers with head injuries should be transported to a facility with neurosurgery. \nSufficient area to examine and treat boxers who would not to be transported to a medical facility \n\nRequired Medical Equipment\nOxygen is mandatory including tubing and delivery devices. \nStretcher/backboard when EMT on site \nNo obstruction that would prevent stretcher, EMT\u2019s or Physician from moving Boxer to ambulance. \nRigid cervical collar when EMT on site\nPenlight\nGauze\nClean, disposable gloves\nAirways\nSanitizer\nBlood pressure cuff\nStethoscope\nTongue depressors\nAdhesive tape\nOphthalmoscope \nOtoscope\n\nHealth and Safety Officer\nResponsible for administering temporary aid towards injured members during both club practices and sparring.\nIn close contact and with the current facilities safety coordinator in case of an emergency. Responsible for documentation in case of an injury.\nWorks with the secretary to keep record of injuries and monitor members with existing injuries that were medically cleared to participate.\nMay also hold another executive or non-executive position in the club.\n\n\nARTICLE VIII:\nNon-Discriminatory and Freedom of Speech Clauses\n\nNon-discrimination\n\n\nThe UMass boxing club hereby vows to never deny a person membership based on race, ethnicity, political affiliation, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, income, disability, age, academic status, veteran status, mental capacity, or criminal record, unless such practices are deemed to be within the bounds of Federal and/or State law. We also vow never to exclude members from meetings, training, competitions, club events, voting rights, use of facilities, a training/sparring partner, or officer position based on the aforementioned demographics. The UMass boxing club vows to support any individual, of any demographic previously stated, in the development of their boxing career. We also vow to make reasonable accommodations to our routines and schedules for those individuals who may need it. The UMass Boxing Club shall question membership to any individual who will not adopt these vows.\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nFreedom of speech will not be limited or restricted by any officer or body of the UMass Boxing Club. A members\u2019 speech is not relevant to any proceeding conducted by the UMass boxing club. No officer or member shall use the speech of another officer or member as reason to deny or limit participation in any UMass boxing club activity.\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IX:\nAmending the Constitution\n\nProposal\n\n\nA written proposal must be made in order for an amendment to the constitution to occur. The proposal should be sent to the president who will then schedule a meeting so that the member may defend their proposal. The proposal will be put to a vote where a two-thirds majority is required for the vote to pass. If the amendment passes then the president must add the amendment to the constitution. The amended constitution must be peer reviewed and checked for correct language before a final copy is created and made available to the club.\nAll officers must be present at the meeting\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nPrimary Source Documents\n\n\nVenegas, Brent R. \u201cBoxer\u2019s Attire and Equipment.\u201d 2008 Basic Rules and Hints for Beginning Officials, (2007): 1-5.

Your involvement in student organizations can play a positive role \nin your college experience and influence the greater UMass community. Our role is to help you and your \norganization(s) maximize your potential by building character, engaging in collaboration, and promoting \ncampus-wide and global citizenship. The 2016-2017 Student Organization Handbook is the first step in \nfulfilling this role. This handbook will provide you and your organization with tools and resources to \nnavigate your way through the complex and ever-changing nature of the University of Massachusetts. \n\nThe student organizations of today will be able to shape the culture, reputation, and history of the \nUMass of tomorrow. From cultural showcases to national competitions to local and global service \nprojects, student organizations present an opportunity for students to express passion, reflect on \nexperiences, and understand diverse voices and perspectives. During your time at the University of \nMassachusetts we hope that you take the opportunity to explore multiple organizations to expand your \nknowledge and experiences. \n\nAlong with this handbook, we have created a student organization resource series that includes \nworkshops, videos, and handouts regarding areas of policy knowledge, financial management, \norganizational management, and community building. Be sure to check out Campus Pulse to see our \nupcoming events and access our online resource. \n\nWe hope that this handbook serves as a valuable tool for your organization\u2019s success and we look \nforward to working with you and your organization. Your experiences as a student leader at UMass will \nbe challenging and rewarding, and we are excited to see what you accomplish. \n\nGo UMass! \n\n~ UMass Student Activities & Involvement Team \n416 Student Union Building \n413-545-3600 \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAbout Us \nUniversity of Massachusetts Student Activities & Involvement \nUMass Student Activities & Involvement (SA&I) strives to offer the UMass community with support for \nevent planning and campus programming needs. Our multiple unique teams provide a wide array of \nservices available to UMass community members.  \n\nSA&I is made up of Student Activities, Fraternities and Sororities, and the Student Organization Resource \nCenter (The SORC). \n\nMission & Goals \nStudent Activities and Involvement strives to be an office that is student-centric and recognizes learning \ntakes place both in and out of the classroom, and that creates opportunities for students to expand their \nknowledge and skills in new settings. \n\n\uf0b7  An office that is exemplary of the best practices in stewardship and fosters innovation. \n\uf0b7  An office that provides integrated support services that embrace and further the strategic \n\ngoals and initiatives of the Division of Student Affairs and Campus Life \n\n\uf0b7  An office that is resourceful and channels efficiencies into furthering the co-curricular \n\nstudent experience and the goals of the department. \n\n\uf0b7  An office that seeks to increase the overall campus presence of student leadership and \n\ncommunity service. \n\nOffices Within Student Activities & Involvement \n\nStudent Activities \n Student Activities & Involvement helps keep most of UMass Amherst\u2019s student life running smoothly: \nstudent organizations, the Student Government Association, student businesses, fraternities and \nsororities, student success centers and multicultural resources. \n\nAlthough most of the organizations within Student Activities are fueled by student members, the \nStudent Activities staff provides essential assistance and oversight, helping students successfully run \ntheir organizations. They also help the groups work together and find common ground in their \nprogramming and events. Student Activities\u2019 resources include help with managing organizations, \nfinancial record keeping, purchasing and payroll, budgeting, fundraising and grant seeking.  \n\nEach RSO is assigned a Student Activities Advisor and Account Specialist. These are the people that you \nwill work with when planning events, traveling, and applying for funds. Your Student Activities Advisor is \na resource that you and your RSO should stay in contact with on a regular basis. \n\nOffice of Fraternities and Sororities \nCollectively, fraternities and sororities constitute one of the largest student groups on campus, and \nmembership makes up about 5.5% of the undergraduate population. Fraternities and sororities are \nabout scholarship, community service, philanthropy, brotherhood, sisterhood, leadership, and lifelong \nfriendships. It's about bettering the UMass Amherst community and the Town of Amherst through \nservice and social functions. It's about traditions, learning valuable lessons, and establishing life-long \nfriendships. It's about shaping the identity of one of the nation's most prestigious campuses with a \ncontinuing fraternity presence since 1869. \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\fStudent Organization Resource Center \u2013 The SORC \nThe Student Organization Resource Center or SORC is the first stop for RSO questions and support. The \nSORC is staffed by students trained in skills to support RSOs and their members. Many of the student \nstaff members are members and leaders of RSOs themselves and they have firsthand knowledge of what \nis needed to function as an RSO here at UMass.  The SORC is where your RSO mailbox is located as well \nas computers and printers, SA&I documents and forms and where you can make appointments to meet \nwith SA&I staff. \n\nStudent Government Association (SGA)  \nThe SGA is a group of undergraduate students elected by the UMass student body. The main duties of \nthe SGA in regards to RSOs are: \n\n\uf0b7  Advocate for the needs of students and student groups \n\uf0b7  Oversee the Student Activities Trust Fund \n\uf0b7  Run the annual budget process, through which money is allocated to RSO for the upcoming \n\nyear \n\n\uf0b7  Review and approve new RSOs \n\uf0b7  Organize and allocate office space within the Student Union Building \n\uf0b7  Provide emergency funding to RSOs throughout the year  \n\nSecretary of Registry: The Secretary of the Registry interacts with many student groups to help prepare \nthem to become and operate as Registered Student Organizations (RSOs). The Secretary is the person \nwho helps acclimate students to our RSO processes and affirms the success of our newest organizations. \nThe Secretary of Registry\u2019s job is to represent RSOs to administration, defend them from unfair policy \nchanges, and represent their best interests, with consultation from many differing groups. The Secretary \nof the Registry also oversees student office spaces in the Student Union/Campus Center complex and \nprovides access to three different conference rooms. RSO promotion and the New RSO Process are \nsome of the largest projects undertaken for the year. Email: sgaregistry@umass.edu \n\nSection 2: What it Means to be an RSO \n\nThere are a few types of student organizations. This handbook primarily focuses on undergraduate \norganizations recognized by the Student Government Association as RSOs. The end of this section will \ncover basic information regarding other types of student organizations. \n\nBefore getting started it is important to understand the context in which you will operate as an RSO. The \nRSO designation is awarded by the Student Government Association (SGA) and gives groups certain \nrights and responsibilities. It provides groups with official recognition as part of the University, but also \nmakes them subject to all policies and procedures that govern the operation of a large, complex \ninstitution. Authority and responsibility for these operations begins with the Board of Trustees and is \ndelegated downward through the University hierarchy. For student activities, the Trustees authorized \nthe creation of the Student Activities Trust Fund (SATF) to provide an accounting framework for all \nactivities. The mandatory Student Activities Fee that is required of all undergraduate students is put into \nthe SATF and distributed by the SGA to provide funding for student organizations and programs. \n\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAs an officer and a member of an RSO it is important that you are aware of all levels of accountability \nand that you remember that you and your RSO represent the University and the student body at all \ntimes \n\nDefinition of an RSO \nAs defined by the SGA, all Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) shall be associations composed \nprimarily of undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which are \ndemocratically directed by their members, independent, and registered by the Student Government \nAssociation. Each RSO shall enhance the social, cultural, educational, and/or recreational experience of \nundergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. \n\nA two-thirds majority of the members of an RSO must be undergraduate students enrolled at UMass \nAmherst. No less than ten UMass undergraduate student members must be active members of the RSO \nat all times. \n\nFor the purpose of this definition, \u201cmembership\u201d shall refer to active members with full voting and \nparticipation rights. Membership must be voluntary and actively entered into by each member, and may \nnot be automatically established. This definition does not preclude an RSO from establishing additional \nclasses of membership defined in alternative ways. \n\nOfficers must be full-time undergraduate students. To become an RSO, members of the organization \nmust complete an activation packet. \n\nIn simple terms, RSO status can be granted to a group of ten undergraduate students who share a \nsimilar interest that is not being met on campus. The ten students must complete the activation \npacket and all required information and submit the packet to the Secretary of the Registry.  \n\nFor more information please see the SGA Bylaws \u2013 www.umass.edu/sga/organization  \n\nRelationship to UMass \nThe University of Massachusetts Amherst campus is designated as an educational environment for the \nintellectual growth and enjoyment of its community members. Student organizations, part of the UMass \nexperience since its creation, are a vibrant and enriching part of the student life on campus. UMass \nrecognizes the distinct and permanent influence that student organizations have on the campus \ncommunity and learning. The actions and views of student organizations at UMass do not necessarily \nrepresent the views of the University. It is import to realize that the conduct of you and your RSO \nmembers reflect on the University and that improper behavior may be reported to the Dean of \nStudents. \n\nBenefits of Being an RSO \n\nThe following rights and privileges are accorded to all Registered Student Organizations: \n\n\uf0b7  Recognition by the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an official Registered Student \n\nOrganization, lending legitimacy when requesting public figures to present at RSO events, when \npublicizing activities, and when fundraising \n\n\uf0b7  Use of university facilities and services such as indoor and outdoor space, A/V equipment, and \n\nvans for travel, either for free or at a discount \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nInsurance when a group is off-campus or traveling, and assistance in case of emergency. \n\n\uf0b7  Access to purchase from vendors at special low UMass contract prices \n\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\uf0b7  Status as an educational, non-profit organization, with exemption from Massachusetts state \n\nsales tax on RSO purchases; large donations can be tax deductible for the donor.   \n\n\uf0b7  Free access to tables on the Campus Center concourse for information, recruitment and \n\nfundraising purposes \n\n\uf0b7  Access to Campus Pulse to: \n\no  store important RSO documents in a permanently accessible location -- documents such \n\nas how to produce your annual events  \n\no  keep your membership list/contact info  \n\no  message some or all of your members with a click \n\no  hold discussions on your wall \n\no  store photos \n\no  hold elections \n\no  use the \u201cInterests\u201d feature to get your RSO and its events suggested to Campus Pulse \n\nusers with the same interests  \n\n\uf0b7  Right to free legal assistance from SLSO (Title VII, Chapter 3) \n\n\uf0b7  Assistance from Student Activities in the way of mail and telephone service, scheduling space, \n\nevent development, leadership training and organizational development, financial accounts and \nbudgeting support and recruitment (Activities Expo). \n\nBenefits of Participating in an RSO \n\nRSOs develop the following transferable real-world skills in students: \n\n\uf0b7  Teamwork  \n\uf0b7  Creativity (conceiving of activities their RSO will do) \n\uf0b7  Event planning / preparation / coordination \n\uf0b7  Financial management \n\no  Budgeting \no  Monitoring expenditures and accounts \n\uf0b7  Marketing / Publicity / graphic design / Public speaking \n\uf0b7  Organizational development (how to make the RSO ever more effective) \n\uf0b7  Conflict resolution \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Evaluation/assessment after event over \n\nLeadership/Supervision / Delegation / Mentoring \n\nIn addition, participation in an RSO enriches the lives of students by providing them with opportunities \nfor social and recreational enjoyment, growth in their fields of interest, and resume-building.   \n\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fStarting a New RSO \nStudent must follow these steps to start a new Registered Student Organization: \n\n1.  Formulate a clear purpose for your group. \n\na.  Check Campus Pulse to ensure similar groups do not exist. If one or more does, feel free \nto reach out to them to talk about joining or possibly incorporating your ideas into their \nalready existing RSO. \n\n2.  Make sure that you have at least ten members who are interested in joining the organization. \nThis includes 4 members who will be a part of the executive board (President, treasurer, Vice \nPresident, and Secretary). Keep in mind, that to ensure the continuity of the organization, not all \nmembers can be seniors, and all members must be undergraduates of the 5-College Consortium, \n2/3 being UMass undergraduate students.  \n\n3.  Set up a meeting with the Secretary of the Registry and inquire about any upcoming application \ndeadlines, and the Secretary will advise you in more detail on the process of becoming an RSO. \nAt this time, you will be able to ask any questions regarding the benefits of being an RSO, \nfunding from SGA, using space on campus, etc. You will also be given specific instructions on \nhow to fill out the application. \n\n4.  Fill out Application & Write a Constitution \u2013Once you have consulted with the Secretary of the \nRegistry you can go ahead and fill out the application, which will be on the Campus Pulse \nwebsite. A significant portion of this application will consist of filling out your RSO\u2019s \ncharter/constitution. Constitutions must have the following components: \n\na.  Officials RSO name \nb.  The RSO\u2019s mission or purpose statement \nc.  The RSO\u2019s requirements for membership \nd.  The role and responsibilities of the RSO officers \ne.  The requirements for voting on group issues \nf.  The structure and timing for officer elections \ng.  The requirements for amending the constitution \n\nA sample constitution can be found on Campus Pulse or on the SGA website. \n\n5.  Make your RSO sustainable (Input SGA expectations) This can be done in various ways: \n\na.  Considering not having all your original offices be seniors \nb.  Simply thinking about or even outlining in your constitution, ways to recruit new \n\nmembers/inspire interest in your RSO for future students \n\nc.  Bringing more than just your officers to the new RSO orientation workshop (like younger \n\nstudents who show an interest in becoming future officers) \n\nd.  Coming up with an effective system of training newly elected officers to be \n\nknowledgeable leaders of the RSO \n\n6. \n\nIf your application has been approved and recognized by the Secretary of the Registry, you will \nreceive an e-mail containing the dates and times of a New RSO Orientation Workshop. You will \nbe required to attend the orientation, in order to learn how to handle the daily financial and \nlogistical operations of an RSO, and attend the Signature Responsibility training. It is required \nthat the President and Treasurer (or equivalent) of your organization attend this workshop, \nalthough it would be great for all the executive leadership, or all new members, at larger, to \nattend. Upon completing the New RSO Orientation Workshop, you will be fully active, and able \nto function as an RSO of the SGA. \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fThe SGA meets every Monday night at 7:00pm to review old business and discuss new business. \nApplications for new RSOs are accepted by the deadlines set by the SGA. For more information about \nthe application process please visit the SGA website or contact the SGA Secretary of Registry. \n\nRSO Councils  \nEvery RSO is part of a council, depending of the category of the RSO. The councils are organizations \ncomprised of a representative from each RSO that share related characteristics. There are 8 Councils: \nAcademic, Advocacy/Political, Arts & Media, Cultural, Greek, Sports Council, Leadership and Service, \nReligious and Spiritual. The SA&I office is currently advising RSOs through this council method, however \nthe goal is for every council to become recognized by the SGA in order to request their budget as a \ncollective, giving RSOs more power and voice when processing and requesting their budget. \n\nRSO Status \nBeing an RSO is not as easy as getting your friends together and receiving approval from the SGA. Once \nyour organization receives RSO status is must keep it. In order to function as an active RSO there are a \nnumber of requirements that must be met every year. If these requirements are not met then your RSO \nwill be moved from active to frozen, locked or withdrawn status. \n\nActive \nNew RSOs are considered active once they receive approval form the SGA and they complete New RSO \nTraining. New RSO Training is held in the fall, and the New RSO training will be held in the spring.  New \nRSO Training is not all-inclusive and you will be required to follow up in the SORC or with your SA&I \nAdvisor for more detailed information. New RSOs must have their President and Treasurer complete \nonline Signature Responsibility Training as well. Once New RSO Training and Signature Responsibility \nTraining are complete the RSO is active and ready to conduct RSO business. \n\nRSOs can be moved from active status to frozen, locked or inactive at the discretion of the SGA and/or \nSA&I. Reasons for losing active status include but are not limited to not meeting the requirements \nneeded to be an RSO, poor financial management, Dean of Students and disciplinary issues, poor \ncommunication with SA&I, poorly representing the University at RSO functions, and hazing and \nalcohol use. \n\nFrozen \nIf your RSO is frozen it is one step away from being considered an active RSO. This means that you \nrecently lost your active status because a requirement was not met. Being frozen also means that your \nCampus Pulse page is no longer active or visible to people looking for your group. You may not have the \nrequired RSO officers or completed Signature Responsibility. It may mean that you missed Activation \nTraining or RSO Registration. It may also mean that you are not communicating with SA&I. Being frozen \nmeans that your RSO is not able to function, hold RSO events, travel, or use RSO funds. In order to \nbecome unfrozen and regain active status you will need to meet with SA&I staff and figure out why you \nare frozen and what you need to do to change your status. \n\nLocked \nIf your RSO is locked it has done something more than miss Activation Training or Registration. Being \nlocked usually means that your RSO has been frozen for at least 2 semesters and has not been working \nwith SA&I. Being locked will require you to do more than just complete Signature Responsibility training \nor Activation Training; you may need to meet with SA&I and the SGA to become active again. \n\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fInactive \nIf your RSO has reached inactive status it has not been active for at least 4 semesters. When an RSO \nbecomes inactive it is removed from Campus Pulse and loses all financial accounts and support from \nSA&I. Inactive RSOs must reapply to the SGA and, if approved, they must complete all the necessary \nsteps needed to become active, often the same steps as starting a new RSO. \n\nOther Types of Student Organizations \n\nAgencies \nAccording to the SGA bylaws, agencies are co-curricular organizations, operating under the guidance and \nsupervision of a full time staff member of Graduate Student Assistant which provides services to the \nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst students, including but not limited to advocacy, activities, or \nmedia. \n\nFraternity and Sorority Life \nThe UMass Greek community offers undergraduates a fraternal experience that complements the \nmission of the University. In partnership with faculty, staff, alumni, families, and (inter)national \norganizations, we challenge and educate students in the areas of leadership, cultural awareness, \npersonal and group development, scholarship, and civic responsibility. \n\nFraternities & Sororities have been an integral part of UMass from the early days. Greek organizations at \nUMass are made up of groups of individuals with various interests. They are bonded together by \ncommon goals and aspirations. These bonds are strengthened by honor, friendship, truth, knowledge, \nand character. Greek membership carries with it many benefits including leadership opportunities, \nacademic support, an emphasis on service, and a bond of brotherhood and sisterhood. \n\nStudent Activities & Involvement recognizes that fraternities and sororities are an integral part of the \ncampus community and can have a positive impact for members and non-members. The privilege of \nfraternities and sororities to exist as part of the University brings with it a high level of responsibility. To \nachieve mutual success for the University and its Greek organizations, there must be trust and shared \nresponsibility. Fraternity and sorority chapters and the governing councils are part of the \nRecognized/Registered Student Organization (RSO) program, and are entitled to the same privileges and \nhave the same responsibilities as all student organizations.  Chapters and councils are provided advising \nand event development support through SA&I, and chapters/councils must complete the necessary \nrequirements established by SA&I and the SGA to maintain an active status on the campus. \n\nThese are the following existing Greek Councils on campus: \n\nInterfraternity Council \n\nThe Interfraternity Council is the governing body of the fraternities that are affiliated with the North-\nAmerican Interfraternity Conference and those local chapters that have membership on the council. \nMember chapters send two delegates, one usually being the chapter president, to council meetings. The \ncouncil officers are elected from the membership of the council and serve in office for one calendar \nyear. The IFC coordinates recruitment for the member chapters, sets standards, and facilitates \nrelationships. The IFC cooperates with other councils to sponsor Greek Week, guest speakers, and other \nactivities. \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fMulticultural Greek Council \nThe fraternity movement at the University is almost as old as the institution itself. Fraternity and \nsorority chapters are open to all matriculating students at the University. However, there are fraternities \nand sororities that specifically serve the needs and interests of specific multicultural-based \ncommunities. These organizations are a part of a larger network of international fraternities and \nsororities that have collegiate and graduate chapters throughout the country and abroad. Affiliating \nwith a Multicultural Greek Council fraternity or sorority presents the member with an opportunity to \nmeet with other students of diverse backgrounds from this campus and other campuses as well as \npeople from the greater community. \n\nEvery MGC fraternal organization has very strict requirements that must be met in order to affiliate (the \nintake process). In general, a student must successfully complete 12 academic credit hours, obtain a \ncertain grade point average, complete an application packet, secure recommendations, and meet the \nfinancial obligations in order to complete the intake process. If you are a brand new student to the \nUniversity, you will not be able to apply for membership until your second semester. If you are a \ntransfer student, you will need a copy of your academic transcript from your previous institution, \ndocumenting your completion of 12 credit hours and your grade point average. \n\nThe governing councils of the MGC fraternity and sorority system sponsor an information session for all \nstudents in the fall. Representatives from each chapter are in attendance and available to discuss their \norganization with you. Additionally, each chapter will host an information session that will be open to all \ninterested students. These sessions are advertised through the campus newspaper and through \npostings. \n\nNational Pan-Hellenic Council \nThe National Pan-Hellenic Council, Incorporated is currently composed of nine (9) International Greek \nletter Sororities and Fraternities: Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., \nKappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Phi Beta \nSigma Fraternity, Inc., Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc., and Iota Phi Theta \nFraternity, Inc. The NPHC promotes interaction through forums, meetings and other mediums for the \nexchange of information and engages in cooperative programming and initiatives through various \nactivities and functions. \n\nPanhellenic Council \nThe Panhellenic Council is the governing body of the sorority chapters which belong to the National \nPanhellenic Conference (NPC) or chapters which have chosen to affiliate with the council.  Council \nofficers are elected from the membership of the chapters and serve a one-year term.  The \nchapters/council conducts a week-long formal recruitment process in the fall semester.  Members from \nthe chapters assist prospective new members (PNMs) by serving as recruitment counselors, also known \nas Rho Gammas.  The Rho Gammas assist PNMs with the navigation of the recruitment process, which \nallows PNMs to see every chapter at least once.  The Panhellenic Council sponsors events and activities \nfor the system and serves as a coordinating body with the other councils. \n\n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPrograms: \n\nUMASS FTK (For the Kids) sponsors the UDance program and is open to all students.  A steering \ncommittee guides the organization through the year.  The program/UDance event raised over $83,000 \nfor the Children\u2019s Miracle Network/Baystate Children\u2019s Hospital in Spring 2016. \n\nThe Order of Omega Honor Society is open to the 3% of the fraternity and sorority membership who \nexcel in leadership, service, and academics.  \n\nAdditional Affiliates \nThe fraternity and sorority program also advises Phi Sigma Pi Honor Fraternity (FSP), Alpha Phi Omega \nService Fraternity (AFW), the marching band fraternity/sorority: Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma \n(KKY/TBS), and Omega Delta Sigma (WDS)\u2013 veteran\u2019s fraternity. \n\nDepartmental \nDepartmental student organizations are student organizations that have not gained recognition by the \nSGA, SA&I or Graduate Student Senate (GSS). These organizations are housed within a specific \ndepartment at UMass. Departmental organizations have some of the same benefits as all other \nrecognized organizations except for the ability to apply for funding. Funding accounts must be housed \nby the sponsoring department. The sponsoring department is solely responsible for the student \norganization\u2019s activity and presence on campus.  \n\nAwards for Registered Student Organizations  \nThe Student Life Award Ceremony (Sammies) is held annually in an effort to highlight the outstanding \nwork of UMass students, registered student organizations, and other campus agencies. These are some \nof the many awards:  \n\n\uf0b7  The Award for Outstanding New RSO \n\uf0b7  The Award for Outstanding RSO Event of the Year \n\uf0b7  The UMass Amherst Spirit Award \n\uf0b7  The Award for outstanding student Engagement Undergraduate Student Employee \n\uf0b7  The Eunice R. Konieczny Student Leadership Award.  \n\nSection 3: Organizational Practices, Recruitment, Meetings, and Conflict \n\nOfficer Responsibilities  \nOfficer responsibilities will vary depending on the size and culture of the organization. A president of a \n100-member organization will have different duties compared to a president of a 10-member \norganization. It is important to have a constitution that clearly outlines officer responsibilities and to \nrevisit these responsibilities semi-annually. Below are some general responsibilities each position may \nhave.  \n\nPresident  \n\n\uf0b7  Oversee executive board meeting  \n\uf0b7  Meet and communicate regularly with Advisor  \n\uf0b7  Delegate tasks when appropriate  \n\uf0b7  Assist in budgeting process  \n\n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\uf0b7  Represent organization in \u201cbig picture\u201d meetings  \n\uf0b7  Re-register organization yearly on Campus  Pulse  \n\uf0b7  Take advantage of collaborative opportunities  \n\nVice President  \n\n\uf0b7  Assist president when needed  \n\uf0b7  Oversee general body meeting  \n\uf0b7  Manage day-to-day responsibilities of organization  \n\uf0b7  Act as liaison to general body members  \n\uf0b7  Assist in budgeting process  \n\uf0b7  Responsible for building camaraderie within executive board and general membership \n\nSecretary  \n\n\uf0b7  Maintain RSO Campus Pulse profile page  \n\uf0b7  Communicate updates to President and Vice President  \n\uf0b7  Take and distribute minutes from the meetings  \n\uf0b7  Record attendance at meetings and events  \n\uf0b7  Send out emails from the organization  \n\uf0b7  Maintain a membership roster on Campus Pulse  \n\uf0b7  Store documents that preserve important policies & procedures for future officers, such as \n\nthe steps to be taken in holding an annual event \n\nTreasurer  \n\n\uf0b7  Check monthly account balances with Business Center Staff  \n\uf0b7  Monitor Summit (online record of income, expenses, and fund balances) \n\uf0b7  Maintain financial records  \n\uf0b7  Submit request for funding forms to SGA and represent organization at hearings  \n\uf0b7  Give balance updates at meetings  \n\uf0b7  Oversee fundraising efforts  \n\nOther Positions to Consider  \n\nEvent Coordinator \u2013 become an expert on knowing how to plan events at UMass and the policies \nassociated with event planning  \n\nPhilanthropy - if the organization is philanthropic, this board member will lead those efforts  \n\nAdvocacy - a board member that advocates on behalf of the student organization  \n\nRecruitment - charged with recruiting and organization activities fairs and general recruitment efforts  \n\nPublicity - does general advertising for organization and specific advertising for events held by the \norganization \n\nSafety Officer \u2013 required for all Club Sport RSOs, must be certified in CPR/First Aid/AED and document \nand report all accidents and injuries \n\n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fOutside Advisors  \nStudent Activities and Involvement encourages all recognized student organizations to have an outside \nadvisor. An outside advisor can be a full-time employee of UMass, either as a faculty member or staff \nmember or a member of the Amherst community. RSO coaches and instructors are considered outside \nadvisors. Student organizations are run and managed by students themselves, but outside advisors can \nplay a key role in offering guidance and advice.  \n\nStudent organization advising is not a science; there is no equation that can be applied to make a \nsuccessful advisor/advisee relationship; instead it is the art of human development and understanding \nthe changing needs of a group. Advisors are also often seen as the knowledge holder for the group \nbecause of the transitory nature of student organizations; however, it is important to remember that \nRSOs are student run organizations.  \n\nHere are some typical roles that advisors often find themselves in:  \n\n\uf0b7  Maintaining a consistent mentor relationship with organization officers (president, \n\ntreasurer, etc.)  \n\n\uf0b7  Assisting in university policy interpretation for the group  \n\uf0b7  Mediating internal conflict  \n\uf0b7  Providing expertise in a specific area of study  \n\uf0b7  Assisting in connecting group with campus resources  \n\uf0b7  Advocating for the group within the university, department, or community  \n\uf0b7  Acting as the primary contact source from university administration in times of crisis, \n\ndiscipline, or disorganization.  \n\nIt is recommended that students and advisors meet regularly (weekly, biweekly, monthly) to update \neach on the progress and status of the organization. The consistency and regularity that student and \nadvisors should meet will vary depending on the nature of the organization and the schedules of each. \n\nSelecting an Outside Advisor  \nAlong with your assigned SA&I Advisor your organization should seek an outside advisor. While there is \na benefit of having consistency from year to year, sometimes an advisor can get too busy, go on a \nsabbatical, leave UMass, or is no longer able to support the student organization. If the student \norganization is looking to find a faculty or staff member that has similar interests as the organization, \nthe corresponding department is a natural place to start. For example, if the organization is a \nperformance group, the theater department may be ideal. Similarly if the organization is focused around \na specific population, an identity center or language department may be best. Whatever the case may \nbe, it\u2019s important that the advisor and the students meet to discuss what the expectations are of each \nother.  \n\nLiability  \nAdvisors do have potential liability exposure, and should understand their obligations to actively and \neffectively provide advice (\u201clegal duty of care\u201d) to the organization. Depending on the intended scope, \ncomments could be as simple as \u201cto the extent advisors become the subject of claims or other liabilities \nas a result of their role, they are covered by the University\u2019s liability insurance programs so long as the \nalleged acts giving rise to the claims/liabilities fall within the scope of their official duties.\u201d  \nIn addition to supporting student organizations, Student Activities also provides support and resources \nfor student organizations advisors. If advisors have any questions, they can contact any of SA&I staff \nmembers. \n\n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fRSO Risk Management  \n\nPhysical  \nPhysical risks can include things such as food poisoning, injuries that may result from physical activities, \ninjuries that may result from travel related accidents. It is important to ALWAYS take the appropriate \nprecautions when your organization is selling/distributing food, hosting an athletic competition, or \ntraveling for organization sponsored events. Student Activities and Involvement requires a participation \nagreement for all field trips or off-campus events to notify participants of potential risks in certain \nactivities.  \n\nReputation  \nReputational risks are those that may result in negative publicity for your organization, members of the \norganization, UMass, your advisor, or the venue where the event is held. Consult with your advisor if \nyour organization has any question about the appropriateness of a flyer, an event name, or nature of an \nevent. If you\u2019re hesitant about asking your advisor, it\u2019s probably not appropriate.  \n\nEmotional  \nEmotional risks are those things that can cause a participant at your event or in your organization to feel \nalienated or cause emotional stress from the activity. Emotional stress (among other things) is a direct \nresult of hazing and hazing-like activities. While an event or group activity may not be physically \ndangerous, emotional stress can have just a large an impact. \n\nFinancial  \nFinancial risks are those things that negatively impact the fiscal stability of your organization and/or \nother organizations financially supporting your organization. It is imperative that the organization\u2019s \ntreasurer and rest of the executive board, including the advisor, stay informed and vigilant about all \naspects of the organization\u2019s financial health. There are instances where unaccounted expenses may be \ncharged to the organization\u2019s account and put the organization in a deficit. An example of this would be \nwhen an organization uses a venue for free, but incurs a cleaning fee because the venue was left messy \nafter the event. If the treasurer doesn\u2019t regularly check the organization\u2019s balance on Summit, the \norganization runs the risk of an overdraft which can put your RSO in poor standing with SA&I and UMass \nservice providers such as the Campus Center and providers of meeting and event space.  \n\nStudent Activities Trust Fund (SATF) Financial Advisor \nCasey Gaw is the new Student Activities Trust Fund (SATF) Financial Advisor. This position was created to \nbetter support RSO\u2019s in their financial needs, including providing guidance on financial processes, \nopportunities for funding, and help with future financial planning. Casey provides financial advising for \nthe Student Government Association (SGA) and serves as a primary staff resource for student budget \nprocesses that recommend the allocation of mandatory student activities fees exceeding $2.5 million \nannually. Casey develops and provides training for RSO officers and members on various financial \npractices and issues throughout the year. She also collaborates with other Student Engagement Staff \nand seeks to educate, advise and counsel students on acquiring individual life skills, leadership skills, and \nto promote organizational development within student groups. RSO students are encouraged to meet \nwith Casey anytime to discuss any problems or ask any questions. She is located in Student Union 416 \nand can be reached by email at cgaw@umass.edu or by phone at 617-545-8173. Walk-ins are also \nalways welcome! \n\n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFacilities  \nFacility risks are those things that may prevent event from being held (weather, fire code, etc) or cause \nproperty damage. If your event or activity is held outside, it\u2019s important to have a rain location or \nanother date reserved in case of poor weather conditions. It is also important to pick an appropriate \nvenue for the nature of your event as to prevent any damage to the facility and thus incur maintenance \nfees. \u2013include a list of facilities according to the type of the event. Ex: SUB, CCA, Mullins Ice Arena, \nAthletic Field Space, Academic rooms, etc.  \n\nMitigating Risk \nThere are several ways to mitigate risk but the basics of risk management come down to a cyclical \nprocess. Assess, Evaluate, Manage, and Measure. Managing risk is not an end product rather, it\u2019s a \nconstant process. First the organization needs to create a measurement of risk. Determine what is \nconsidered risky and what is not. If the organization has issues with this measurement, SA&I staff \nmembers will be happy to assist with this process. With any event or activity put on by the organization \nthe organizers should always assess the risk involved. Next evaluate how risky the different components \nof the event are. Finally determine how to manage and eliminate risks. \n\nEvents and activities are one of the most important aspects for registered student organizations at \nUMass in creating a community, providing leadership development opportunities for members, and \nsending a message about what the organization values. There are just as many different types of \nregistered student organizations on the UMass campus, as there are a variety of events that registered \nstudent organizations and their members may host or attend throughout the year. Each event offers \nunique opportunities and challenges. Therefore, it is important for registered student organizations and \ntheir members to plan carefully for any potential risk; consider how the event may reflect on the \norganization; and utilize the many resources available for planning assistance when hosting events on or \noff-campus. \n\nHazing   \nHazing is a serious infraction of university regulations. The potential for hazing typically arises as part of \na student\u2019s introduction to or initiation in an organization (fraternity, sorority, athletic team, or other \ngroup) in which there is often a perceived or real power differential between members of the \norganization and those newly joining it.  \n\nUniversity Hazing Policy \nAll students are subject to the following act of the Massachusetts Legislature (General Court) which \nmakes hazing a crime. Action may be initiated for alleged violation(s) of this act under applicable \nsections of the Code of Student Conduct. Students may also be subject to lawsuits by victims of hazing. \n\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the \nauthority of the same, as follows:  \n\nDefinition \nThe term \"hazing\" as used in this section and in sections eighteen and nineteen, shall mean any conduct \nor method of initiation into any student organization, whether on public or private property, which \nwillfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person. Such \nconduct shall include whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced \nconsumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug, or other substance, or any other brutal treatment or \n\n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fforced physical activity which is likely to adversely affect the physical health or safety of any such \nstudent or other person, or which subjects such student or other person to extreme mental stress, \nincluding extended deprivation of sleep or rest or extended isolation. \n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the contrary, consent shall not be available as a \ndefense to any prosecution under this action. \n\nPenalty \nWhoever is a principal organizer or participant in the crime of hazing, as defined herein, shall be \npunished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment in a house of correction \nfor not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment. \n\nDuty to report \nWhoever knows that another person is the victim of hazing as defined in section seventeen and is at the \nscene of such crime shall, to the extent that such person can do so without danger or peril to \nhim/herself or others, report such crime to an appropriate law enforcement official as soon as \nreasonably practicable. Whoever fails to report such crime shall be punished by a fine of not more than \none thousand dollars. \n\nNotice  \nEach institution of secondary education and each public and private institution of post secondary \neducation shall issue to every student group, student team or student organization which is part of such \ninstitution or is recognized by the institution or permitted by the institution to use its name or facilities \nor is known by the institution to exist as an unaffiliated student group, student team or student \norganization, a copy of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen; provided, however, that an \ninstitution's compliance with this section's requirements that an institution issue copies of this section \nand sections seventeen and eighteen to un-affiliated student groups, teams or organizations shall not \nconstitute evidence of the institution's recognition or endorsement of said unaffiliated student groups, \nteams or organizations. \n\nLevels of Hazing \nHazing activities and situations include, but are not limited to:  \n\nLevel I  \n\n\uf0b7  Marching in line  \n\uf0b7  Road trips  \n\uf0b7  Wearing apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste, and/or \n\ninappropriate for the time of year  \n\n\uf0b7  Calisthenics  \n\uf0b7 \nLine-ups  \n\uf0b7  Pledge/signature books  \n\uf0b7  Periods of silence  \n\uf0b7  Standing for a length of time  \n\uf0b7  Personal servitude \n\uf0b7  Activities that would not normally constitute hazing but because of time, place, or \n\nmanner make them inappropriate \n\nLevel II  \n\n\uf0b7  Sleep deprivation or interruption of consecutive sleep hours  \n\n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\uf0b7  Expected or forced consumption of food, drink (including alcohol), or other substance  \n\uf0b7  Acts of humiliation or degradation (including streaking or wearing degrading or \n\nhumiliating apparel)  \n\n\uf0b7  Restrictions on eating or bathing  \n\uf0b7  Acts that disrupt academic instruction or learning of others  \n\uf0b7 \nInterruption of or interference with academic commitments  \n\nLevel III  \n\n\uf0b7  Branding  \n\uf0b7  Paddling in any form  \n\uf0b7  Compromising (sexual) situations  \n\nAny individual or group found responsible for hazing will be subject to sanctions outlined in the \ndisciplinary process, including, but not limited to: disciplinary probation, social suspension, suspension \nof charter, restrictions on member recruitment and/or group activity, removal of the individual from the \ngroup, loss of housing privileges, suspension, and/or expulsion. Sanctioning will increase with the level \nof violation and any previous hazing violations. (Levels of violation listed above are guidelines only and \nmay change given particular circumstances of a violation.) Acts or potential acts of hazing may be \nreported to the Dean of Students Office (413-545-2684) or UMass Police (911 or 413-545-2121). You can \nalso discuss hazing or potential hazing with your SA&I Advisor. \n\nAlternatives to Hazing  \nIn general, groups should design new member activities that focus on the mission, purpose and function \nof the organization. If an activity doesn\u2019t reflect favorably on the reason the group exists then another \nactivity should be used. Commitment and dedication to the group\u2019s values and purposes will come from \nactually engaging in activities that promote those values and purposes.  \n\nIntramural sports through Campus Recreation  \n\n\uf0b7  Ropes/Challenge Course  \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Attend UMass sporting events  \n\uf0b7  Do a hands-on service project for the elderly, children, etc.  \n\uf0b7  Attend campus special events (plays, concerts, lectures) as a group  \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Educational programming regarding the history of the group and/or the University  \n\uf0b7  Movie Night  \n\uf0b7  Group Dinners  \n\uf0b7  Community, campus or facility beautification projects (adopt a road, habitat for humanity)  \n\uf0b7  Participate in a mentoring program  \n\nInvite alumni to campus for Homecoming activities  \n\n(Adapted from the University of Michigan\u2019s \u201cSee through the Haze\u201d publication) \n\nFor more information about the University Hazing Policy please read the Code of Student Conduct: \nhttp://www.umass.edu/dean_students/sites/default/files/documents/2014-\n2015%20Code%20of%20Student%20Conduct.pdf \n\nRecruitment \nRecruitment refers to the process of contacting, screening and selecting qualified members for an \norganization. A few well-known ways to recruit are: \n\n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWord of mouth: one of the best ways to recruit members. \n\n\uf0b7  Have your RSO members pass on information about your organization; people are more \n\nlikely to join if they already know at least one member. \n\nAdvertise: a great way for RSOs to catch the attention of new members.   \n\n\uf0b7  Through Campus Pulse \n\uf0b7  Through social media \n\uf0b7  Through tabling in the Campus Center Concourse \n\uf0b7  At the Activities Expo \n\nEvent Recruiting: works to create a larger membership base. \n\n\uf0b7  At your events, whether on or off campus, try to encourage new people to join your club \n\uf0b7  Provide easily accessible information about your organization at events \n\nRunning Effective Meetings \nBefore the meeting: \n\n\uf0b7  Define the purpose of the meeting \n\uf0b7  Develop an agenda with the officers and advisor \n\uf0b7  Choose an appropriate meeting time and length \n\uf0b7  Choose a location that is easily accessible for all members \n\uf0b7  Advertise the time and place of the meeting to your members \n\nDuring the meeting: \n\n\uf0b7  Greet members and make them feel welcome \n\uf0b7  Start on time and end on time \n\uf0b7  Review and follow the agenda and set priorities for the meeting \n\uf0b7  Encourage group discussion and feedback \n\uf0b7 \n\nIf non-agenda issues/questions threaten your timeline, note them down for the next \nmeeting\u2019s agenda \n\n\uf0b7  Keep minutes of the meeting in case a question or problem arises \n\uf0b7  Summarize the accomplishments of the meeting and end on a unifying or positive note \n\nAfter the meeting: \n\n\uf0b7  Send minutes of the meeting to all group members in case a question or problem arises \n\uf0b7  Discuss any problems that came up during the meeting and brainstorm ways to approach \n\nthem \n\n\uf0b7  Put unfinished business on the agenda for the next meeting  \n\nManaging Conflict \nThe 8 essential steps to conflict resolution \n1.  Create an effective atmosphere \n2.  Clarify perceptions of the conflict \n\na.  What is everyone\u2019s perception of the conflict? Is it relevant? \n\n3.  Focus on individual and shared needs \n4.  Build shared positive power \n\n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fa.  Seek to promote the constructive capabilities of all parties involved in the conflict \n\n5.  Look to the future, learn from the past \n\na.  Use the past to see what might have gone wrong and focus on the present and future to \n\nact on the realization of the past \n\n6.  Generate options \n\na.  All parties must creatively suggest and imagine a wide range of ways to resolve the \n\nconflict. \n\n7.  Develop achievable action steps  \n\nAction steps should \n\na.  Stand a good chance of being accomplished \nb.  Not favor one party at the expense of other parties \nc.  Meet both shared and individual needs \nd.  Require the participation of all parties involved \n\n8.  Make mutually beneficial agreements \n\na.  Mutually beneficial agreements must be built on clarified perceptions of the conflict, the \nparties involved in the conflict, and the specific steps each party has agreed to take to \nimprove the relationship. \n\nDelegation \nDelegation (or passing down) is the sharing of authority and responsibility to another person (normally \nfrom a manager to the person they supervise) to carry out specific activities. It is one of the core \nconcepts of leadership. However the person who delegated the work remains accountable for the \noutcome of the delegated work. Delegation empowers another person to make decisions, i.e. it is a shift \nof decision-making authority from one organizational level to a lower one. Delegation, if properly done, \nis not abdication. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a manager provides \ntoo much input, direction, and review of delegated work. In general, delegation is good and can save \nmoney and time, help in building skills, and motivate people. Poor delegation, on the other hand, might \ncause frustration and confusion to all the involved parties \n\nWhen should you delegate? \nAsk yourself 4 questions: \n\n1.  Does the task provide an opportunity to help someone grow and develop skills? \n2. \n3. \n4. \n\nIs this a task that will happen again in the future? \nIs there enough time to delegate the task effectively? \nIs this a task that needs to be done by you? \n\nHow should you delegate? \n\n\uf0b7  Clearly articulate the desired outcome \n\uf0b7  Clearly identify constraints and boundaries \n\uf0b7 \nIf possible, include other members in the delegation process \n\uf0b7  Match the amount of responsibility with the amount of authority \n\uf0b7  Establish and maintain reporting structure and control \n\nLeadership Transitioning \nIn order to ensure the continued success of your RSO it is important for the transition between new and \nold leadership to go smoothly. RSOs often fail because there was no communication between leaders, or \nbecause old leaders left the RSO rapidly and without passing on important information. For an effective \ntransition process your RSO should do the following: \n\n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\uf0b7  New leadership should be elected by April 1st \n\uf0b7  Once new leaders are elected, have a transition meeting with both the old and new leaders \n\uf0b7  Old and new leaders should meet with your SA&I advisor to establish a strong working \n\nrelationship \n\n\uf0b7  Old leaders should explain Campus Pulse to the new leaders \n\uf0b7  Old leaders should orient new leaders to the resources used in the past \n\uf0b7  Old leaders should work with the new leaders on the RSO budget for the upcoming year \n\uf0b7  Old leaders should create a binder that includes files, documents and acquired wisdom \nconcerning the topics above, which will be helpful to the new leaders. If the binder is a \n\u201ccyber binder\u201d on Campus Pulse, it will always be easily locatable and available to the \norganization, and changes to it can be made easily.  \n\nTeambuilding \nThere are many different ways to build a cohesive team. By being intentional about teambuilding \nexercises and hosting a proper facilitation, organizations will be able to see tangible results quickly. It is \nimportant to set realistic expectations relative to the size of your organization. It is more likely a group \nof seven will be able to find a team identity quicker than a group of 25. Here are a few things to keep in \nmind when you are thinking about teambuilding activities. \n\n\uf0b7  Host retreats where members can get to know each other, set expectations, and create \n\ngoals for the academic year \n\n\uf0b7  Members will feel more connected to you organization if they know other members \n\uf0b7  Formal team building activities can help members get to know one another. Informal get-\n\ntogethers, outside of your regular RSO meetings are also a good way for members to get to \nknow each other. \n\n\uf0b7  Set goals for your group with the entire group if it is small enough. \n\uf0b7 \n\nIf you organization is large, set goals with your executive board for the entire group \n\nOnline Presence \n\nUniversity IT Guidelines \nIt is the policy of the University of Massachusetts Amherst to maintain access for its community to local, \nnational, and international sources of information and to provide an atmosphere that encourages the \nfree exchange of ideas and sharing of information. Access to this environment and the University's \ninformation technology resources is a privilege and must be treated with the highest standard of ethics. \n\nThe University expects all members of the community to use computing, data, and information \ntechnology resources in a responsible manner, respecting the public trust through which these \nresources have been provided, the rights and privacy of others, the integrity of facilities and controls, \nstate and Federal laws, and University policies and standards. \n\nStudents can find the policies here: http://www.umass.edu/it/policies \n\nCampus Pulse \nCampus Pulse is an online tool used for recruitment, information, event planning and documentation. \n\n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fStudent Activities and SGA require that all RSOs use and maintain a page on the Campus Pulse network. \nCampus Pulse may be used by Student Activities and the Student Government when it is time to allocate \nfunds to RSOs. \n\nDomain Names and Websites \nPublic facing, informational Web sites for departments, administrative offices, and other official campus \norganizations can be hosted on the www.umass.edu server. \n\nUniversity Web sites are stored on University Web servers and are created by colleges, schools, \ndepartments, or other administrative offices for University business. Sites hosted on www.umass.edu \nare intended for general public informational use, and conform to the University\u2019s Web identity \nguidelines. \n\nIf you need to set up a new Registered Student Organization (RSO) Web site or obtain the login \ninformation for an existing site, contact Melinda Nielsen, mnielsen@stuaf.umass.edu, 413-577-2305. \n\nWeb Site Options \n\nClassic HTML-based Sites \nIT provides hosting for traditional HTML-based sites for Web pages that do not require the advanced \nfeatures provided by a Web content management system, like Drupal. This service is also recommended \nfor groups on campus who do not have dedicated resources available to support their Web site. \n\nDrupal Web Content Management Sites \nIT, in collaboration with University Relations, provides a Drupal-based Web content management service \nto groups hosting their Web sites on www.umass.edu. \n\nFacebook \nRSOs are encouraged to use Facebook as a promotional tool. Facebook is also a good way to \ncommunicate with RSO members and advertise RSO events. It is important to remember that an RSO \nFacebook page not only represents the RSO but also the university. Inappropriate images and/or use of \nuniversity logos can lead to disciplinary actions. \n\nTwitter \nTwitter is another vital promotional tool that RSOs can use, where you can create surveys; send out \nimmediate and simple updates of your RSO events or meetings. Again, it is important to remember that \nan RSO Twitter page does not only represents the RSO but also the university. Inappropriate images, \nlanguage, and/or use of university logos can lead to disciplinary actions.  \n\nOther \nThere are a number of social media tools that can be great resources for RSOs. It is up to your RSO to \ndecide which social media outlets, if any, are going to be the most useful for your organization. \nFacebook or Twitter may be you preferred options but Instagram, Google+, LinkedIn, and even Snapchat \nare also viable options to promote your RSO. If you have questions about using social media sites to \npromote your RSO please meet with an SA&I advisor. \n\nSection 4: Finances \nAs a Registered Student Organization you have been recognized by the Student Government Association \nand the University. This means that you now represent the University and you are eligible to receive \n\n22 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ffinancial support from the SGA and the University. As an RSO within the university system you receive a \nunique account numbers that are specifically related to your RSO. This information is entered into the \nUMass Amherst system as well as the UMass system as a whole. In order to use RSO funds you will need \nto know your specific RSO information as well as how to use the UMass purchasing system. \n\nDepartment ID Number \nEach Recognized Student Organization is given a unique 10 digit number that is used to identify the \norganization. Your RSO department ID number will be used when you reserve space, make financial \ntransactions or conduct any kind of RSO business. Your RSO department ID number can be found on \nyour RSO Campus Pulse page by officers of your RSO. \n\nAccounts \nRegistered Student Organizations are also given two university accounts. Your RSO must use these two \naccounts and only these two accounts for group funds; outside accounts are not allowed. \n Each RSO is assigned a Fee account and a Revenue account. Each RSO account has a unique 6 digit \naccount number, called a speedkey or speedtype, which is used to identify the exact account when you \nare trying to make payments or spend your RSO money. RSO forms and documents that are missing a \nspeedkey or department ID number will not be processed by SA&I staff.  Each RSO is responsible for \nmaintaining its own \"books\", or records of its financial transactions.  The monthly account statements \ncan be found on the University financial software Summit, similar to viewing an online bank statement. \nSummit should not be relied upon to govern the day-to-day activities of your group - your own records \nshould be much more current \n\nFee Account \nFee money comes from the mandatory activities fee that each UMass undergraduate student pays. Fee \nmoney is allocated as an annual budget from the SGA Ways and Means Committee or as emergency \nfunds from the SGA Finance Committee. Fee money is allocated yearly by the Ways and Means \nCommittee and is available for use after July 1st. \nFee Accounts are separated from Revenue Accounts in order to monitor how RSOs spend their fee \nmoney. Fee money cannot be transferred to Revenue Accounts.  \nFee money is allocated in specific budget categories and for certain purposes. It is your responsibility to \nspend the money responsibly and according to the purpose for which it was allocated. \nUnspent funds in the Fee Account at the end of the fiscal year will be returned to the SGA.  \n\nRevenue Account  \nRevenue accounts are assigned to all RSOs and contain any money not classified as Student Activities \nFee money. \n\nSources of revenue may include: \n1. Membership dues \n2. Proceeds from sales  \n3. Fundraising money  \n4. Donations \n5. Grant allocations  \n6. Ticket sales  \n7. Funds from other University departments \n\nPurchases using revenue funds should be appropriate to your RSO purpose and mission. \n\n23 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fRevenue money carries over from one year to the next. If your RSO has $200 in its revenue account in \nMay, it will reflect as a $200 balance in September. \n\nAll RSO funds are considered University funds, even thought you may have raised money individually \nor contributed money from your own pocket. As such, spending is subject to the same policies and \nprocedures for all University funds. \nFunding \n\nSGA Funding \nEvery Registered Student Organization is eligible to receive funding from the Student Government \nAssociation. The SGA is responsible for allocating a portion of the Student Activities Trust Fund to RSOs \nthat submit qualifying budget requests. The allocation process is held during the spring semester with all \ndecisions being finalized before the end of the academic year. Funds allocated by the SGA will be \navailable for use at the start of the financial year, July 1st. \n\nTo apply for funding RSOs, must follow these steps:  \n\n1.  Attend your Council\u2019s budget information session \n2.  Fill out the Budget Request Form on Campus Pulse page, according to the SGA Ways and Means \n\ncommittee\u2019s Funding Guideline.  \n\n3.  Fill out the required RSO information about the previous year. \n4.  Fill out the budget information for the previous year. \n5.  Create a budget for the upcoming year. \n6.  Submit your budget application via Campus Pulse by your Council/the SGA deadline. \n7.  Wait to hear back regarding your allocation. \n\nOnce you receive notification of your allocation, make sure you understand how/why you were funded. \nIf confused, reach out to the Chair of Ways and Means (sgawaysmeans@umass.edu) or your advisor. If \nyou are still unsatisfied you may wish to appeal your budget before allocations are made final. \n\nSignature Responsibility  \nAll transactions of money through your RSO accounts must be initiated or approved by an officer with \nSignature Responsibility. Signature Responsibility is gained by taking the necessary trainings and \ncompleting the requirements presented through SA&I. Signature Responsibility requirements and \ntrainings will be accessible starting on the first day of classes for the fall semester. All RSO Treasurers are \nencouraged to have Signature Responsibility. All RSO transactions should be made using your RSO \naccounts and students should not use personal funds to make RSO payments. \n\nSpending RSO Money \nAll RSOs are expected to maintain accurate records of their financial transactions. As an officer for your \nRSO you should have a good understanding of your organization\u2019s finances and you should be able to \nanswer these questions: \n\n1. What is your RSO budget? \n2. How much has the RSO spent or committed? \n3. Will there be sufficient funds in the RSO accounts for upcoming events? \n4. Have bills been paid? \n5. Have all transfers been accounted for?  \n\nYou do not want to put your RSO in a situation where you have received goods or services, only to find \nout that you do not have the funds or the University will not approve payment from your RSO account.  \n\n24 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fYour Student Activities (SA&I) advisor is the primary contact for approval along with the Business Center \nstaff, but other approvals may be needed. Purchases over $10,000 require approval from the \nProcurement Department while some purchases require the approval of the University attorneys or \neven the Vice Chancellor.  \n\nCash purchases are absolutely prohibited; they leave no paper trail in University records and can be \nsubject to fraudulent activities. Do not purchase with cash! \n\nThe University does not reimburse purchases that were made without prior approval. You cannot \nreimburse RSO members, coaches, advisors or parents for purchases that they make without SA&I \napproval! \n\nThere are multiple ways to make purchases from a student organization account. The type of purchase \nmethod will depend on the vendor or purchase type. Links to the necessary forms can be found on the \nBusiness Center we page, or on the Campus Links drop down on Campus Pulse.  \n\nContracted University Vendors \nThe University has contracts with vendors for certain products, which means that all university \ndepartments and organizations use that vendor as the primary provider for specific products. In return, \nthe vendor will provide lower prices and better service to the university.  Contracted Vendors must be \nused whenever possible. Using a non-contracted vendor requires extra steps and therefore, usually \ntakes more time to process. \n\nSA&I and The SORC maintain a list of the types of contract purchases that RSOs commonly make.  The \nSORC has a binder detailing this information, including contact names, addresses and other information \nyou need when completing a purchase request.  Most of these contracts include other vendors that are \nnot located in our geographical area but nevertheless are open to your inquires for item availability and \nprice comparison.  To get a complete list of contracts and all vendors that pertain to each, you can visit \nthe campus procurement department web site at: \n\nhttp://www.umass.edu/procurement/commcont.html \n\nPurchase Request \nA Purchase Request is the form that is used to start the payment process and leads to a Purchase Order.  \nOnce the Purchase Request form is completed, submitted, and approved, a Purchase Order (PO) is \nstarted. A Purchase Order sets aside money in your group's account for a particular purchase (or group \nof purchases). Once issued, a purchase order outlines the types of goods and services your organization \nis purchasing and commits the university/your RSO to pay the vendor. POs are subject to university and \nstate regulations and are exempt from Massachusetts sales taxes. You may not verbally promise \npayment if you are purchasing with a purchase order. Once a purchase order is created, a copy will \nautomatically be sent to the vendor by the university. \n\nPurchase Request Process   \nTo best understand the Purchase Request/Purchase Order process, please read the steps below: \n\n1. Research item to be purchased and request a quote from the vendor \n\na.  You may go to the Student Organization Resource Center (208 Student Union) to look up \n\ncontracted vendors \n\n2. Go to Campus Pulse and complete the \u201cPurchase Request\u201d form found on the Campus Links drop \n\ndown on Campus Pulse \n\n25 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fa.  Fill out the Purchase Request electronically with the appropriate information. \n\n3. Once approved and created, an electronic copy of the Purchase Order will be emailed to the \n\nvendor \n\na.  Approximately 3 business days later \nb.  Vendor must receive PO before creating merchandise \n\n4. Merchandise is shipped to Student Organization Resource Center  \n\na.  Must be shipped with an invoice \n\n5. Student sends the invoice to Account Specialist to be paid \n\na.  Vendor may not receive payment for 3-4 weeks after invoice has been submitted \n\n**For a Purchase Order that is $10,000 or more, you will need to request 3 quotes from 3 different \napproved University vendors before filling out a Purchase Request form.  The PO will also take a few \nmore days to process because of the need for approval by Procurement.** \n\nSASP Card \nStaff members in the Business Center Office have Student Activities Student Purchasing (SASP) credit \ncards for student organizations to use. A SASP Card is a MasterCard you can use for purchases under \n$1000.  When purchasing using a SASP card, the vendor does NOT have to be a contracted vendor by \nthe University.  This card may be used for an online purchase (online purchases can only be done in the \nBusiness Center office) or you may temporarily check out the card to make a purchase at a store off \ncampus.   \n\nSASP Card Process \nTo best understand the Purchase Request/SASP Card process, please read the steps below: \n\n1.  Research item to be purchased and fill out SASP Request form on the Campus Links drop down \n\non Campus Pulse \n\n2.  Once the request is approved by the group\u2019s advisor: \n\na.  Make appointment, through The SORC, for group member picking up card to meet with \n\nAccount Specialist   \n\ni.  Group member picking up card does not have to be member who filled out the \n\nform  \n\n3.  Meet with Account Specialist on the day you plan to pick up the SASP Card \n4.  Use SASP Card \n5.  Bring back SASP Card and itemized receipt(s) by the time and date specified by the Account \n\nSpecialist \n\n**Late returns of SASP Card will result in charges assessed to your RSO.  Misuse may result in \npenalties to individual or RSO** \n\nReimbursements  \nStudents, parents, alums, or coaches who make purchases on behalf of the organization will NOT be \nreimbursed. We have no way of knowing that the student is making purchases allowable by the \nUniversity and is following University policies. T-shirts, mugs, towels, or any paraphernalia purchased on \nbehalf of the student organization must use an approved licensed vendor. SA&I has systems in place to \nmake any and all purchases that your RSO should need, some purchases take longer than others but the \n\n26 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSA&I staff will work with you to help you buy what you need, when you need it. If you have any \nquestions about this, you should contact the Student Organization Resource Center or your SA&I \nadvisor. \n\nInternal Recharge \nThis method of payment is used for internal purchases of the University. Purchases from the dinning \nservices for last minute drinks for an event or Physical Plant supervision and maintenance would be the \nmost appropriate time to use the IR form. The student will need an SA&I staff member to sign off on the \nIR form prior to making any purchase. Students must then get a copy of the receipt or invoice to turn \nback in to SA&I. \n\nTransfer  \nOrganizations have the ability to transfer money from one RSO account to another for co-sponsorships \nor payment for services. Transfer forms can be found on Campus Pulse on the Business Center Office \npage. \n\nContracts \nIf an RSO wishes to have the services of an outside professional that will be charged to the RSO accounts \na Contract Request for Personal Service must be completed. All paperwork must be completed and \nsubmitted prior to service being provided. You may be asked to provide a Certificate of Insurance, if so \nsee your SA&I advisor. \n\nTo complete a Contract Request you will need to meet with your SA&I advisor and provide the following \ninformation: \n\n- Vendor\u2019s personal contact \n\n- Event information \n\n- RSO information \n\ninformation \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nVendor name \n\nVendor address \n\nVendor telephone \nnumber \n\nVendor email \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nEvent name \n\nEvent date \n\nEvent location \n\nPayment amount to \nvendor \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nRSO name \n\nRSO Department ID \n\nRSO account and speed \nkey \n\nAccount balance \n\nA contract is a binding agreement between two or more persons or parties.  When your organization votes \nto sponsor a professional performer or lecturer, it is important for you to know that a contractual \nagreement must be made between the University and the performer's representative.  As students, you do \nnot have the authority to formally negotiate contracts either VERBALLY or in written form.  Your \norganization is part of the University, and therefore the University is the legally responsible party for any \nformal contract.  You must make an appointment with your SAI Advisor to follow through with the process.  \nYour advisor must initiate contract negotiations a MINIMUM of six weeks in advance of the date scheduled \nfor appearance.   \n\nTravel  \nTravel forms are used when student organizations go on organization sponsored trips such as retreats, \ncompetitions, or conferences. They are also used for off-campus dinners, banquets, and venue rentals, \nas well as Field Trip Services bus/golf cart requests. A Travel form acts similar to a Purchase Request or a \nSASP Request and will be used to make ALL payments for the RSO trip \n\n27 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn order to finalize travel arrangements for your trip, you must first meet with your SA&I advisor and let him/her \nknow where you are traveling and what you will need to pay for.   \n\nThe Travel Form must be submitted digitally via Campus Pulse. Once submitted, the Travel Form is downloaded by \nthe Travel Coordinator, who forwards it, along with all the attached documents, to your advisor for approval. Once \nyour form is approved by your advisor, you will receive a notification via Campus Pulse that your Travel form is \nready for processing. The Travel Coordinator will be in touch about payment procedures and appointments. Please \nnote, depending on the complexity of your trip, you may not receive a call until the week of your trip. \n\nMake sure that you hand in your travel form in a timely manner.  Forms should be submitted 2 weeks prior to the \ndue date of your first payment. This ensures enough time for approvals, processing, and booking appointments. \nThere is also a limited number of travel cards available for each weekend. Since these are first come, first served, \nan early submission offers greater likelihood of travel card availability.   \n\nPurchasing Equipment \n\nPurchases over $10,000 \nFor a Purchase Order that is $10,000 or more, you will need to request 3 quotes from 3 different \napproved University vendors before filling out a Purchase Request form.  You will also need to complete \na Sole Source form showing why you are making a purchase over $10,000. You should meet with your \nSA&I advisor to discuss the purchase and necessary documentation and forms. POs will also take a few \nmore days to process because of the need of procurements approval \n\nFundraising and Donations \nThe keys to fundraising are creativity and hard work.  We encourage you to be creative and look for ideas that are \nunique to your organization. Work with your SA&I advisor BEFORE you do any fundraising activity. You will need to \ngo over your finances and discuss the viability of your fundraiser prior to starting it.  Some fundraisers such as \nraffles and bake sales have specific permitting requirements. Since your SA&I advisor is familiar with all of the \ncampus requirements, he or she will be able to help you get started on the right foot.  \n\nFundraising Ideas Include:  \n\n1. Collecting membership dues \n2. Sales on campus center concourse \n\na. Bake sale (requires a permit from EH&S) \nb. Theme sale \nc. T-shirt sale \nd. Raffle (need permit for this from the town hall) \n\n3. Stadium or Arena Clean-Ups \na. Mullins Center \nb. McGuirk Alumni Stadium \n\n4. Donations from parents, friends or Alumni \n5. Crowd Sourcing using MinuteFund: The MinuteFund is a university sponsored crowdfunding \n\nwebsite that students, faculty and staff can use free of charge; 100% of the funds you raise will go \ndirectly to your project!  Student groups such as UMass Habitiat for Humanity, UMass NASA \nStudent Launch Team, UMass Roller Hockey, Extravaganja, Men\u2019s Rugby, and Engineers without \nBoarders have used the MinuteFund to raise between $1,000 and $7,000+.To inquire about \nstarting a MinuteFund project, email stephanief@admin.umass.edu or \nknavin@admin.umass.edu.   \n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f**Please note that door to door sales are not permitted in the Residence Halls as there is a no solicitation policy \non campus.  And ALL FUNDRAISERS must be discussed and approved by your Student Activities and Involvement \nAdvisor before you begin.  Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action by the Dean of \nStudents.** \n\nGrants \nAvailable On-Campus Grants Include: \n\n1. The Engage, Connect, Serve and Achieve Grant (ECSA) provides funding to student organizations \n\nand student affairs departments for events and programs that enhance the co-curricular \nexperience at UMass Amherst. Students can find the ECSA grant application on Campus Pulse on \nthe ECSA Grant profile \u2013 under documents tab, see ECSA Grant guidelines, deadlines, and \nassistance documents. For questions, students can email to ecsagrant@stuaf.umass.edu  \n\n2. Arts Council Grant \n\na. Awarded to groups for arts-related events such as music, dance and theater productions. To learn \n\nabout the grant\u2019s guidelines and deadlines you can visit the Fine arts Center website.  \n\nIf you are planning on submitting a grant, please contact your SA&I advisor.  She/he will walk you through the \nprocess for submitting a grant.  When you have completed the written part of your grant, your advisor must \napprove the grant before submission. \n\nIf you receive a grant, the money will be transferred into your RSO Revenue Account, however all grants are \nmeant for specific events or projects.  Grants may not be used for non-specified or other RSO expenses.   \n\nCash Handling \nCash or checks from fundraisers or RSO dues payments from members must be collected following University \nguidelines, which have been established to ensure that assets are protected and properly and accounted for.   In \nparticular: \n\n\uf0b7 Checks should be made out to: The University of Massachusetts/the Name of your RSO. \n\n\uf0b7 Funds should be deposited promptly into your RSO revenue account, and never held in outside bank accounts or \npetty cash funds.  University guidelines call for daily deposits; even small amounts of cash or checks should not \nbe held for more than a few days.   \n\n\uf0b7 Use common sense when handling cash and checks.  Funds should never be left unattended or in an unlocked \n\nlocation.  For overnight storage before a deposit can be made, see your SA&I advisor or an account specialist.  If \nyou need an escort when carrying large amounts of cash, you may contact Public Safety at 413-545-2121 \n\n\uf0b7 Keep records of all funds collected, including date, amount, payer, and purpose.  Issue receipts when receiving \n\ncash.  Receipt books are available free of charge from your account specialist.  Make sure to issue dated receipts \nto RSO members that make dues payments in cash \u2013 receipts are the only proof that members have made \npayments.   \n\n\uf0b7 Ensure that there are checks and balances among members of your organization so that all receipts are \n\naccounted for and properly deposited.  Individuals collecting funds should not make the deposit, but pass the \nmoney and records to another member to verify the receipts and make the deposit.  Get a receipt yourself if you \nare passing funds on to another.  Treasurers should check Summit transactions to ensure that funds have been \ncorrectly deposited, and group members should ask for periodic financial reports from the treasurer.   \n\n\uf0b7 Please report any discrepancies or losses immediately to SA&I.   \n\n29 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDeposits  \nIn order to deposit funds, you will need the assistance of one of the staff members in the Business Center office.  \nYou must use the deposit form at the deposit work station in room 430 Student Union. Their office hours are \nfrom 8:30AM to 5:00PM, from Monday through Friday. This is an electronic form that you will only be able access \non this computer.  You will bring all of your cash and checks to that location for assistance in preparing a required \ndeposit slip.  Step by step instructions on how to complete the required deposit slip are as follows: \n\n1. Enter your RSO Name next to the \u201cGroup Name\u201d field \n2. Enter the person responsible for the deposit next to the  \u201cDepositor\u201d field \n3. Enter the cash breakdown  \n\na. This is the total amount of cash by each unit of money \nb. The total field calculates for you \n\n4. Under the \u201cDepartment Notes\u201d field, list the checks received  \n\na. For Checks: List the name on the upper left corner of the check and the amount \nb. The business office staff will show you how to stamp the checks front, and back.  \n\n5. Under the \u201cTender Breakdown\u201d field, please confirm that the total is the amount that you wish to deposit.  This \n\ntotal must equal the total in the Accounting Area. \n\n6. Accounting Area \n\na. Enter the Speed Type in this section.  This is a six digit code for your group\u2019s revenue fund  \nb. Enter the six digits Account Code that defines the type of revenue you are putting into your fund.  An \n\naccount specialist will assist you in finding this code at the workstation \n\nc. The Fund is already there for you \nd. Enter your Dept ID which is a specific ID for your group.  It begins with A7 for undergraduate, and A3 for \n\ngraduates. \n\ne. Keep the Project/Grant and Class section blank \nf. Enter the Amount  of funds for the specific revenue category line item \ng. Confirm that the Total Deposit matches the amount of funds you just entered. \n\ni. This should be automatically calculated for you \n\n7. Under the \u201cDescription\u201d section, please provide a short description, which will show on your account \n\nstatements, which defines what the funds were received for.  Note that only 25 characters will be allowed in \nthis field.  \n\nAfter completion of the deposit slip, please have an Account Specialist review your deposit form.  You will need to \nprint out 3 copies, one of which is for your club records.  The other two deposit slips, along with the cash and \nchecks, are to be delivered to the Cashiers Office which is located at the bottom floor of the Campus Center. Their \nhours are from 8:30AM to 3:00PM from Monday, through Friday. You will NOT be given a receipt for this deposit \nso it is important to keep a copy of your deposit slip.  This slip will also help you verify that the recorded amount is \nposted in your revenue account. The deposit will usually appear in Summit within 2-3 business days. \n\n**Make sure you deposit your revenue on the following business day of an event or ASAP.  Students should NOT \nhold on to cash or checks for more than 1 business day** \n\nBudgeting  \nRSO Treasurers are frequently asked questions such as the following: Are we meeting our budget? Do we \nhave enough cash? What is the budget for this event or trip? These questions are posed by other \nofficers, RSO members, advisors examining the organization's progress, or Business Center staff \nmembers reviewing the internal financial statements in an attempt to answer all of the other questions \nrelated to budgeting and the organization's financial well-being. \n\n30 \n\n \n \n \n\fThe ability to budget effectively is crucial to maintaining a successful RSO. An effective budget should \naccomplish the following: \n\n\uf0b7  Provide a framework for decision making. An effective budget assists officers in choosing \n\nbetween multiple events or projects. Treasurers should be allocating funds and resources to the \nprojects highlighted in the budget. \nInform the officers and the members what the financial goals are for the year ahead. Budgets \nare excellent communication tools. \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7  Monitor the financial activity of the organization. On a monthly basis Treasurers should compare \n\nactual income and expenses to their budgets to ensure that spending is in line with revenues. If \nexpenses exceed revenues then steps can be taken to prevent financial losses including reduced \nspending. If income exceeds expenses then the officers can determine an appropriate use for \nthe excess funds. \nIdentify fraud by determining unusual gaps between planned spending and actual expenses. \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Assist the organization's plan for large events or purchases. A comprehensive budget will set the \n\norganization's financial goals for the year in order to fund designated projects. \n\nRSO Treasurers and the e-board members should carefully prepare and track budgets to ensure that the \norganization is staying on track with its mission and vision. \n\nBudgets are made up of general guidelines to outline expenses of an RSO. Student Activities and the \nBusiness Center Office do not have individual RSO budgets; rather they can offer organizations their \nbalance, which informs the budget. \n\nHow to Create a Budget \nSo, how do you make a budget? There are numerous charts and software and all kinds of things that you \ncan buy to help you. They're all fine, but all that you really need is a notebook, a pencil, and a small \ncalculator. Once you have these tools, sit down and list everything that you spend money on in a month. \nEverything! You need to know exactly where your money is going, every penny of it. This may take more \nthan one sitting, because you may have to track your expenditures for awhile, possibly a whole \nsemester. Keep copies of all of your receipts.  \n\nOnce you're aware of what you're spending your money on, you'll be able to put it down on paper. \nMake columns on your paper and label them with the different categories of your spending, i.e. referee \npayment, catering payment, coaching, gas, hotels, and so forth. Make a column for everything. Minor \nexpenditures can be combined into a \"miscellaneous spending\" column. You're probably already \nsurprised at the amount of money that your RSO spends. Allocate your available funds to cover your \nnecessary bills first. As they're paid, keep track of them on your budget sheet.  \n\nOften times the previous year\u2019s executive board will apply for the annual budget and not transition \nproperly so the current executive board knows what the money was allocated for. Again, SGA is likely to \naudit organizations that receive the annual budget, so it is imperative that your organization spends \nmoney only on what was allocated by line item. Approved line item budgets can be found on the annual \nbudget page of SOFC\u2019s website. \n\nSection 5: Event Planning and Programming Guide \n\nWhy program?  \nEvents are a great way to showcase student organizations. Programming events provides an outlet for \ncreativity and experiences to complement or supplement the classroom experience. Programming \n\n31 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fevents can provide a different avenue to experience culture, politics, recreation, and art. They build \ncommunity and encourage collaborations. They range from academically focused and philanthropic to \nsocial gatherings, sporting events, and political discourse. Whatever the occasion, well-planned events \ncan contribute greatly to the daily life of the UMass community.  \n\nEvent Planning and Management  \nStudents and student organizations may host events any time during the academic year, except during \nreading period, exams, and new student orientation, unless authorized by Student Activities and \nInvolvement. The university reserves the right to withhold event hosting privileges if proper advance \narrangements are not secured. \n\nAll RSO activities (everything from meetings to practices and dances to tournaments) require some \nevent planning. An important step in planning an RSO event is to create the event in Campus Pulse, \nwhich will then be reviewed by SAI staff. Once you have put the information into Campus Pulse, \nnotification will be sent to SAI staff who will review the event.  Some programs will require that you \nmeet with an Events Consultant (ECO).  ECOs are students who are involved in campus organizations and \nhave planned many events themselves.  Other events may require that you meet with your SAI advisor \nto discuss aspects like logistics, contracts or food.  \n\nOnce the particulars of the program have been set, you and other members of the club will work on \nsome aspects while SAI staff will make other arrangements for the organization.  Any questions about \nevent planning and the use of Campus Pulse can be directed to either staff in the Student Organization \nResource Center or to your SAI Advisor. \n\nThe following common elements will be required in nearly every event you plan: \n\n\uf0b7  Vision \u2013 Ideally, what would you like the program to include?   \n\uf0b7  Goals and Objectives \u2013 What are you trying to achieve?  How do you want people to feel \n\nwhen they leave?  What do you want group members to learn? \n\n\uf0b7  Collaboration \u2013 Would you want to host this event with another RSO? Split costs with \n\nanother RSO? \n\n\uf0b7  Site Selection \u2013 Pick a site and an alternative just in case. \n\uf0b7  Participants/Attendees \u2013 Who is the intended audience?  Where can you find them?  Who \n\nelse might enjoy your event? \n\n\uf0b7  Promotion \u2013 What media should you use to reach your intended audience? Make sure to \n\ntell them who, what, where and when.   \n\n\uf0b7  Agenda \u2013 This is the detailed outline of the event. Your agenda should cover everything \n\nfrom hours before the event to clean-up after the event. \n\n\uf0b7  Budget \u2013A budget is required by the Student Activities and Involvement.  How are you \npaying for the event? What are all the costs involved \u2013 publicity, food, logistics, and \nperformers?   \n\n\uf0b7  Timeline \u2013 When must tasks be done so that the entire program will be done on time?   \n\uf0b7  Food and Beverage \u2013 Will your event require food and beverages?  \n\uf0b7  Transportation \u2013 Will you need to transport RSO members to the event? Do you have a \n\nspeaker who needs to get to the event? \n\n32 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\uf0b7  Staffing \u2013 How many organizational members do you need to set up?  How many people do \nyou need to run the event?  How many people do you need to clean up?   How will you \nthank them after? \n\nIt is important that you define what your RSO wants to achieve, what your vision encompasses, and \ncommit your intentions to paper. You do this by defining your goals and objectives, setting financial \ngoals/limits, and identifying your participants. You should begin to envision how the event will look and \nfeel early on in the process. \n\nThe most efficient and effective way to create your defined vision is to hold a planning session with your \nRSO members and begin generating attainable goals and measurable objectives. After the vision is \ndetermined you can create committees, assign roles, responsibilities and tasks. Time spent planning in \nthe early stages will result in things running smoothly later on. Meet with your SA&I Advisor or an ECO \nwhen you have questions.  \n\nTarget Audience  \nIt is important that the student organization always keeps the target audience in mind. Be realistic in \nsetting this audience. Just because an event is open to the entire student body, doesn\u2019t mean that \n\u201centire student body\u201d is the target audience. The organization should ask itself, \u201cWho would be \ninterested in going to this event?\u201d and \u201cHow do we get these students to our event?\u201d  \n\nMarketing \nMarketing and publicity material is imperative to promote your event. The material you create will \nprovide information about the event and how to become a participant. Your material can be a poster, \nparty invitation, full-color brochure, one-page flyer, radio spot, newspaper ad, or all of the above The \none thing you must do is create an event on Campus Pulse. The goal of all marketing should be to get \nyour message out to as many people as possible. \n\nOther Marketing tools \n\nUMass Calendar   \nThis is a great tool that RSOs can use in order to promote their event, because this calendar is visited by \nfaculty, staff, students and community members who are trying to see what there is to do in the valley \nfor the weekend. You can submit your event into the UMass Events calendar \u2013 www.umass.edu/events - \nby login in with your Net ID and fill out the request with all the information about your event.  \n\nYour marketing cost should be approximately 10% of your budget. It is important that you weigh the \nbenefits of advertising dollars versus memorable amenities. Do you really need the four-page full color \nbrochure or would you rather spend the money on something special for the event? Campus Pulse and \nword of mouth are the least risky and most effective means of promotion. They are free and require \nvery little time. All RSO members should be involved in publicizing information about RSO events. \u201cDorm \nStorming\u201d is not allowed, if you wish to market in residence halls you must contact Residence Life and \nthey will distribute your material. Any violation of this policy may lead to disciplinary action from the \nDean of Students. \n\nTiming  \nFinding the appropriate timing is two-fold. First the organization needs to see what other events are \nhappening during their proposed event. If its homecoming weekend, a basketball night, or just other \nprograms going on, the organization should think critically about the timing of the event. Once a date \n\n33 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fhas been confirmed, the organization needs to evaluate if the event is far enough ahead to plan and \nexecute a successful program. Things to consider include: personal schedules (midterms, finals, travel), \napplying for funding and purchasing supplies, coordinating with venue, coordinating with catering, \ncoordinating with speaker(s), executing publicity plan, etc. \n\nVenues  \nFactors that will influence the venue will be anticipated size of the audience (again, just because it\u2019s \nopen to everybody, doesn\u2019t mean that everybody will show up), type of event (speaker, dance \nperformance, panel, social), and availability.  \n\nSpace at UMass is in high demand and programming space is limited.   RSOs compete for the use of \nspace with other student groups, academic departments, athletic teams, and outside organizations.  \nRequest space as early as possible \u2013 in some cases space can be requested up to a year in advance.  \nCancelling space or not using it can result in loss of the space in the future and/or a fee charged to your \nRSO. \n\nOn Campus Venues  \n\nCatering Spaces (only reservable for UMass-catered events): \n1. Marriott Center (Campus Center 11th floor) \n2. Hadley Room (Campus Center 10th floor) \n\n3. Amherst Room (Campus Center 10th floor)  \n\nFood is always required for events in catering spaces.

Rec Center Activity Rooms \n10. Southwest Basketball Courts \n\nAnytime an RSO has reserved a facility, it should be used. If an RSO cancels any event, an officer should \ncontact their SA&I Advisor no later than 24 hours, and be aware that the group might still have to pay \nthe bill. RSOs are responsible for overseeing the set-up and cleanup of all sites.  \n\nMisuse of equipment and facilities, as well as inappropriate conduct and actions while participating in \nany RSO related activity, may jeopardize the RSO\u2019s status. Any RSOs using a facility are obligated to clean \nup after the activity and leave the facility in the same condition it was in when the activity started. \nStudent Activities and University staff will be monitoring all facilities when appropriate. As employees of \nthe University they have the authority to deny unauthorized persons, or persons abusing facilities or \nequipment access to the facility. \n\nAlcoholic beverages are not permitted in or on University facilities. It is the RSO\u2019s responsibility to \nmonitor all events, including spectators, to assure that alcoholic beverages are not on site. \nAny violation of University policies may cause events to be delayed until the problem is corrected or \ncancelled if the situation is not addressed. For more information about the University Alcohol Policy \nplease see the policy section of this handbook. \n\nRallies and Protests \nStudent Activities and Involvement supports events such as rallies and protests. We ask that RSOs work \nwith us when planning a rally and, or, a protest, submitting your event on Campus Pulse at least 3 \nbusiness days in advance. SA&I staff will be able to help you plan your events and avoid unforeseen \nissues with permits, timing, and security.  \n\nPicketing Code \n\n1.  All students, undergraduate and graduate, have a right to demonstrate on university premises \nprovided, however, that no such demonstration shall be permissible which for any reason of \n\n35 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ftime, place, or type of behavior materially disrupts class work or other university business, or \ninvolves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others. \n\n2.  Campus buildings are for university business. Any form of demonstration that interferes with \n\nuniversity business in office or classroom spaces is a violation of this Code. \n\n3.  Students are prohibited from blocking free entry to or free exit from buildings, interfering with \nfree movement, or presenting obstacles to regular university activities. \"Interfering with free \nmovement\" is defined as any physical denial or restriction of a person's ability to freely reach or \nleave a given geographical area, or harassment as defined in the Code of Student Conduct. \n\"Obstacles\" are defined as physical devices, bodies, or signs which cause interference with free \nmovement, or sounds which prevent normal aural communication. \n\n4.  There shall be no interference with demonstrations on the grounds of content of speech, except \nfor any speech or demonstration which incites immediate, violent action and represents a clear \nand present danger to the campus community, which shall be a violation of this Code. \n5.  No student shall intentionally and substantially interfere with the freedom of expression of \n\nanother person on university premises or at university sponsored activities. \n\n6.  Failure to cease any activity in violation of this Code immediately following either written or oral \n\nnotice by a university official shall also be a violation of this Code. \n\n7.  Any violation of this Code may subject a student to expulsion from the university or such lesser \n\nsanction(s) as may be deemed appropriate by the university. \n\nProcedures for Individuals and Groups to Provide Goods and Services on Campus \nThe Amherst Campus Providers of Goods and Services Policy (copy available from Auxiliary Services) \nprovides the procedures for the vending of all goods and services on campus. The purpose of the policy \nis to provide the campus community with reasonable controls to ensure the stability and reliability of \nthe goods and services it receives. Further, the University must ensure that all vendors sell products and \noperate in a manner that complies with relevant health and safety standards and precludes campus \nliability issues. \n\nThe following procedures apply to individuals and groups wishing to vend goods or services on campus. \nIf the sponsoring organization is a Registered Student Organization, authorization to vend must be \nobtained from the director of Campus Activities. All other sponsoring groups, organizations, clubs or \nindividuals must obtain authorization from the Director of Auxiliary Services before offering goods or \nservices for sale on the Amherst campus. \n\nOff-campus events  \nRSO events held off-campus fall under the same guidelines as on-campus events. RSOs that hold events \noff campus represent the university and are expected to represent the university in the best possible \nmanner. When planning off campus events you will face the same challenges and follow many of the \nsame guidelines for planning on campus events. You will still need to think about your venue, target \nmarket, marketing and risk management. A few key differences when planning an off-campus event will \nbe venue price, venue appropriateness, and risk management. \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nVenue price \u2013 Using off-campus venues can often be more expensive than using on campus \nvenues. Most off campus venues require a security deposit as well as a cost for food and \nbeverages. \nVenue appropriateness \u2013 Many off-campus venues that can and will host RSO events are bars \nand restaurants. You will have to decide if it is appropriate for your RSO to hold events in such \nvenues. Also, if you are holding an event in a bar you will need to think about your target \nmarket and if it is appropriate to exclude individuals who are not 21+. \n\n36 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\uf0b7 \n\nRisk management \u2013 Risk management for off-campus events is extremely important. Holding \nRSO events in venues that are open to the public, do not have proper security or are \ninappropriate for your RSO event can cause safety issues that do not happen on campus. \nBefore holding your RSO event it is important to address all risk management issues with the \nvenue management staff. \n\nAfter the Event \nAfter every event, tying up loose ends and completing any necessary paperwork are important tasks. \nDebriefing after the event will allow you to meet with everyone involved and review the event. This is \nalso the point where you should make an extensive thank-you list and start showing your appreciation \nfor any help that you receive with the event. \n\nAfter every event you should create a final report for your records. This means consolidating all the \nevent information into one place. You can use this information to track your history and plan future \nevents. These materials will make it easier if the group decides to do the event in subsequent years.   \nThe following should be included in your report: \n\n\uf0b7  Event name, dates and location \n\n\uf0b7  Goals and objectives \u2013 defined vision for the event \n\n\uf0b7  Number of participants \n\n\uf0b7  A facility report with the number of rooms, food and beverage \n\n\uf0b7  Any conclusions or information from the debriefing meeting \n\n\uf0b7  Copies of all marketing materials \n\n\uf0b7  Copies of all handouts and agendas \n\n\uf0b7  The event timeline and checklists \n\n\uf0b7  Original budget estimate \n\n\uf0b7  Actual budget \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nList of all volunteers and staff \n\n\uf0b7  Vendor information, including phone number, key information and if you would use them again \n\n\uf0b7  Copies of all invoices \n\n\uf0b7  Copies of all Student Activities and Involvement paperwork \n\nEvent Planning Resources \n\nBusiness Center Office  \nThe Business office serves every single area within Student Affairs by ensuring the flow of all financial \ninformation runs smoothly and appropriately as well as supporting student organization finance. The \nteam also manages payroll, revenue collection, invoice payments, student SASP card transactions, \nreimbursements and more.  \n\n37 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEnvironmental Health and Safety \nEHS, under the direction of the Office of the Director, provides 24/7 comprehensive safety and health \nservices to the University community in Academic Safety & Environmental Health, Campus Safety & Fire \nPrevention, Emergency Preparedness & Business Continuity and Environmental & Hazardous Materials \nManagement Services. \n\nAuxiliary Services \nAuxiliary Services provides essential services to students, faculty, and staff, contributing to the overall \nenhancement and quality of life of the university community. \nDining Services \n\n\uf0b7  Dining Services \n\uf0b7 \n University Club \n\uf0b7  Catering \n\uf0b7  Retail Dining \n\nCampus Center \n\n\uf0b7  Hotel \n\uf0b7  Catering \n\uf0b7  Conferences \n\uf0b7 \n\n University Store \n\nConference Services \n\uf0b7  Facilities \n\nRSOs can request a meeting room on the UMass Auxiliary Services website: \nhttp://www.umassauxiliaryservices.com/events/events-room-request/ \n\nFine Arts Center \nThe Fine Arts Center seeks to engage and inspire the campus and regional communities in the arts \nthrough a broad array of exemplary performances, exhibitions, and educational programs. \nSince its founding in 1975, the UMass Fine Arts Center has been a central force in the cultural, social and \nacademic life of the University, the Five College campuses, and the Pioneer Valley of Western \nMassachusetts.

SA&I is constantly changing \nwith the landscape of the University and adapting to student needs and culture. That being said, internal \nSA&I policies are also dynamic to make the experience of student organizations and events as smooth \nand successful as possible. For the most up to date policies, please visit the SA&I Campus Pulse page. \nStudents are expected to check the home page of Campus Pulse regularly to stay informed on the most \nup-to-date policies.  \n\n39 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\fUMass Community Standards  \nWe are in an exceptional learning environment nestled in one of the best college towns in America. By \nchoosing UMass Amherst you have accepted all the rights and responsibilities of membership in this \ncommunity. There will be many opportunities to participate in fantastic learning and co-curricular \nactivities. \n\nWith these benefits comes the responsibility to treat each member of our community with civility and \nrespect. As a student you are expected to maintain high standards of personal conduct and participate \nactively in fostering the well-being of this unique educational community. A strong community depends \non respect for the rights of others, considerate behavior and good judgment. \n\nThe Code of Student Conduct helps us realize those goals and focuses our collective efforts into creating \na safe living and learning environment dedicated to academic exploration and personal growth. The \nCode is grounded in a learning process that can result in a personal understanding of our community \nvalues. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the Code and make it part of your daily life at \nUMass Amherst. \n\nSolicitation and Posting Policy \nThis policy is incorporated into the UMass Amherst Code of Student Conduct. Violations of this policy \nwill be subject to action as provided for under the Code. The policies and its guidelines can be found \nhere: https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct \n\nAlcoholic Beverage Policy \nThe goal of the University Alcoholic Beverage Policy is to promote attitudes and behaviors towards \nalcohol use, on and off campus, that are consistent with an atmosphere of civility, and to discourage \nalcohol-related behavior which is abusive to oneself or to others, within the confines of preserving the \ncivil rights of all. In accordance with the University\u2019s commitment to provide a civil, safe, and healthful \nenvironment, confidential services, resources, treatments, and various programs encompassing \neducation and alternatives to alcohol use must be provided to support the needs and concerns of \nmembers of the University community related to alcohol and other drugs.  \n\nGeneral guidelines concerning the use of alcoholic beverages can be found here: \nhttps://www.umass.edu/dean_students/alcoholic-beverage-policy \n\nCOMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR ALCOHOL OR OTHER DRUG RELATED PROBLEMS \nIn accordance with the University's commitment to civility, services and resources are provided to \nsupport individual needs, to assist at crisis points and to provide accurate information \u2014 all related to \nalcohol and other drugs. Listings of resources on campus and in the community are available by calling \nthe Dean of Students Office (413-545-2684), Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Prevention, \nDivision of Health Education, University Health Services (413-577-5181), or the Faculty and Staff \nAssistance Program (413-545-0350). \n\nRaffles, Gaming Activities and Poker Nights \nA person/organization is gambling if he/she/it operates, plays, or bets at any game of chance at which \nany money, property, or other thing of value is bet.  \n\nGaming events such as raffles, casino or Las Vegas nights, or poker tournaments may only be conducted \nby a non-profit organization (whether or not incorporated) that has been organized and actively \n\n40 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n\ffunctioning in Massachusetts for at least two years and is one of the following: \n\n\uf0b7  Veterans' organization chartered by Congress; \n\uf0b7  Church or religious organization; \n\uf0b7  Fraternal or fraternal benefit society, such as an Elks Club or union: \n\uf0b7  Educational or charitable organization; \n\uf0b7  Civic or service club; or \n\uf0b7  Other club or organization operated exclusively for nonprofit purposes. \n\nThese groups are qualified nonprofit organization and represent limited exceptions to the general law \nprohibiting gambling in the Commonwealth.  \n\nA nonprofit organization that is a public charity must register with the Attorney General's Non-Profit \nOrganizations/Public Charities Division (the \"Division\") under M.G.L. c. 12, s. 8E and must be in \ncompliance with the reporting requirements of M.G.L. c. 12, s. 8F and M.G.L. c. 68, s. 19 prior to \nconducting a gaming event. If you do not know if your organization is a public charity, please talk to an \nSA&I advisor. \n\nRaffles, in which a chance to win is sold to participants and the winner or winners are selected from the \nchances actually sold, are regulated by law. Whenever money is charged for the ticket or chance, the \nraffle can be legally operated only by a qualified nonprofit organization. The funds received must be \nused only for the purposes specified in the law. If no money is charged, anyone may legally operate a \nraffle, and businesses often do so for promotional purposes. Consumer protection laws apply to all \nraffles, however. \n\nCasino or Las Vegas nights (also referred to as \"bazaars\") are also regulated because they offer the \nopportunity to play games of chance, such as roulette, craps, blackjack and poker (including Texas \nHold'em) for a prize. These gaming events may be legally operated only by a qualified nonprofit \norganization, and the funds must be used for specified purposes. Beano or Bingo games are regulated by \nthe Lottery Commission. For more information, visit the Lottery Commission website, or call (781) 849-\n5555. \n\nAll qualified nonprofit organizations conducting gaming events must comply with M.G.L. c. 271, s. 7A. In \naddition, the Attorney General has regulations governing raffles at 940 CMR 12.00 (Regulations \nGoverning Raffles) if the cost of a ticket is more than $10 or any prize exceeds $10,000. The Attorney \nGeneral also has regulations governing casinos or Las Vegas nights. See 940 CMR 13.00 (Regulations \nGoverning Bazaars). \n\nPermits for Raffles or Gambling Activities \nA permit from the municipality in which the raffle will be held is required for a qualified nonprofit \norganization to hold a gaming event such as a raffle, casino or Las Vegas night, or poker tournament. \nThe nonprofit must obtain the permit from the clerk of the municipality. If you plan to hold a raffle, \ncasino night or other gaming activity you will need to complete the Raffle Permit paperwork found on \nCampus Pulse and visit the Amherst Town Clerk. \n\nThe nonprofit must provide: \nIts name and address; \n\n  Evidence that it is eligible to hold a raffle or bazaar; \n  Names of three officers or members who will be responsible for the operation of the event; and \n  The uses to which the net proceeds will be applied. \n\n41 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fA permit received from a municipality is valid for one year from the issue date. There is no limit on the \nnumber of raffles that may be held. A nonprofit may conduct only three gaming events during that \nperiod; a gaming event may not last longer than five hours and no more than one event may be held on \nany single day. \n\nWhile there are no Massachusetts laws expressly regulating online raffle sales, certain regulations may \noperate to prevent online sales. For example, both the purchaser and the seller must sign the raffle \nticket under 940 CMR 12.00 (Regulations Governing Raffles) if the prize is worth more than $10,000 or \nraffle tickets cost more than $10. \n\nIn addition to state law, federal law may also apply. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, \npassed on October 13, 2006 (31 United States Code s. 5361-5366), restricts online gambling in states \nthat do not require age and location verification. Massachusetts does not currently regulate online \ngambling. Nonprofit organizations seeking to conduct online raffles should be aware that such raffles \nmay violate federal law and should first consult with their own attorney, as the Division provides advice \nonly with respect to state law. \n\nOnly bona fide members of the licensed nonprofit organization can be involved in the operation of a \ncasino, poker night, raffle or other gaming activity. The members cannot be paid for their involvement in \nthe gaming event. Employees of companies providing equipment or supplies for the gaming event may \nnot be involved in the management or operation of the event. \n\nTaxes on the Money Raised from Gaming Activities \nYes, within 10 days after conducting a raffle, casino or Las Vegas night or poker tournament, the \nnonprofit organization must pay a five percent tax on the gross proceeds to the Lottery Commission. The \nLottery Commission will send the required forms to the nonprofit after the permit is issued. \n\nWithin 30 days after the permit expires, the nonprofit must provide to the city or town clerk two copies \nof a report certified by the same three people who applied for the permit containing: \n\n\uf0b7  Number of gaming events held; \n\uf0b7  Amount of money received; \n\uf0b7  Amount spent on expenses; \n\uf0b7  Names of winners of prizes of more than $25 in value; \n\uf0b7  Total net proceeds; and \n\uf0b7  Use of the funds. \n\nThe town clerk will provide the nonprofit with a copy of the report that must be filed. \n\nUNIVIERISTY SEALS, LOGOS AND MARKS \nUMass Amherst designated graphic elements, colors, and typefaces should be used consistently in all \npresentations.

We particularly strive to assist \nstudents in resolving problems for which it would be otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain legal \nservices at affordable prices. In this way, we help the University to accomplish its goal of retention of \nstudents and enhancing the quality of students\u2019 university experience. \n\nIn addition, we are dedicated to improving the university environment for all students by promoting \nfairness, equality, and the protection of students\u2019 individual rights and interests. We play an active role \nin addressing issues of diversity and multiculturalism on the campus by advising individual students and \ngroups regarding civil rights law, and participating in training programs for students and staff. \n\nAs a law office primarily funded by student fees, we believe that we have a special obligation to educate \nstudents as to their legal rights and responsibilities, both individually and through community legal \neducation (CLE) programs. We also seek to promote the rights of students in general, by acting to \nfurther the cause or progressive change in the state and local community. \n\nWe strive to support the university\u2019s educational mission by providing \u201chands-on\u201d experience to \nstudents who are exploring the option of legal careers, through our internship program. In the \ninternship program, we provide practical training as well as opportunities to engage in problem solving \nand teamwork with other students and professional staff. \nhttp://www.umass.edu/rso/slso/ \n\n52 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fStudent Union Craft Center \nThe Student Union Craft Center is an educational service and crafts supply store. As a multidisciplinary, \nsocio-educational program, our primary purpose is to enrich student life on campus. We provide \ninstructional crafts programs in a contagiously creative and welcoming environment. \n\nThe origins of The Craft Center are one of creativity, friendships, education and entrepreneurship. In \n1971, while driving between the five colleges, Penny Worman, a leather specialist, stopped to pick up a \nhitchhiker. Upon seeing the many belts in Worman's car, the hitchhiker asked her what her occupation \nwas. Worman told him that she makes a living by going between the colleges teaching people how to \nmake belts. The hitchhiker then proceeded to tell Worman of a student craft guild at University of \nMassachusetts where they needed a professional supervisor. Worman applied and over 30 years later, \nthe Student Union Craft Center is serving students in ways Worman might have only imagined. That \nwinter of 1971, the students of UMass made 2000 belts between the end of November and the end of \nexams. Such productivity has remained the tradition in this modest space across from the Hatch--the \nspace where students go, make crafts, and depart as friends. \n\nhttp://www.umass.edu/craftctr/ \n\nUnion Video Center \u2013 UVC TV19 \nUVC-TV 19 is UMass Amherst's student-run television station. Our mission is to serve as a training facility \nfor all facets of video production, while providing undergraduate students with a welcoming \nenvironment in which to learn. We broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on HSCN channel 19 on the \nUMass campus. \nhttps://www.umass.edu/uvctv19/ \n\nUniversity Police \nWith a population of over 35,000, including 11,000 resident students, UMass Amherst is both a center \nfor higher education and a city in itself. As in any municipality of similar size, our police force works to \nprevent and respond to criminal activity and emergencies. However, the UMass Amherst Police \nDepartment has the additional responsibility of maintaining a safe campus where education and \nresearch can thrive; where students, staff and faculty can achieve their goals free from the concerns of \npersonal and campus safety. This mission guides all of our work. \n\nIn order to ensure a safe campus, the UMass Amherst Police Department takes a community policing \napproach to public safety. This is a comprehensive way of thinking that enables officers to be proactive, \ndetermining why problems happen and working on solutions rather than simply responding to each \nemergency. We develop community policing through the careful training of officers, flexibility, outreach \nprograms, and problem-solving partnerships with faculty, staff, and students, our Amherst neighbors, \nand state and local government. \n\nUMPD officers attend the Municipal Police Training Committee (MPTC) training academy, and possess \npowers, authority, and responsibilities identical to municipal police officers in the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts. We strive to maintain the highest ethical and performance standards in our policies, \nprocedures, and actions. \n\nOur department operates 24 hours per day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, providing patrol, \ninvestigation, specialized and emergency response, as well as crime prevention and educational \nservices. Officers are also a familiar presence in the residence halls, working closely with staff and \nsecurity to maintain a safe environment. They utilize a variety of policing options that provide ultimate \n\n53 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fmaneuverability and increased presence, and that allow officers to get to know students, faculty, and \nstaff.

During the school year, the bulk of the Upward Bound programming will take \nplace at Commerce High. In the summer, there will be a bridge program component that will take place \non the UMass campus. \nhttps://www.umass.edu/cmass/upward-bound \n\nWMUA Radio \nWMUA  is  a  federally-licensed  broadcast  facility  managed  by  the  Student  Activities  Trust  Fund  (SATF)-\npaying  students  of  the  University  of  Massachusetts  to  serve  the  Connecticut  River  Valley  of \nMassachusetts,  Connecticut,  and  Vermont.  WMUA  operates  in  stereo  at  91.1  megahertz,  FM  channel \n216 as authorized by the Federal Communications Commission. \n\nOver  the  recent  past,  professional  radio  stations-both  public  and  private,  have  turned  to  ever  more \nsophisticated  market  analysis  in  order  to  determine  the  format  and  music  that  will  \"sell\"  best.  As  a \nstudent,  non-commercial  station,  in  many  ways  insulated  from  the  concerns  of  a  commercial \nenvironment, WMUA need not make programming decisions based on demographics, market research, \nsponsor demands and other non-musical factors. \n\nWMUA sees itself as a repository and mouthpiece for music, new and old, which rarely get heard on the \nradio.  This  attitude  provides  an  opportunity  to  learn  about,  and  share  with  our  audience,  authentic \nmusic from various musical subcultures in the United States as well as the great musical cultures of the \n\n54 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fworld. There is no need for us to duplicate the service that is found redundantly throughout the radio \ndial. WMUA thus tends to focus on music made by lesser known artists, or those working in styles that \nare judged by expert radio marketers to be of limited commercial value. \n\nWMUA is committed to music and public affair programming that speaks to the diverse University and \nPioneer Valley community. In this important way we are different than most student stations that tend \nto gear their programming towards a white college-age audience. \n\nWMUA uses a format called \"block programming\".  A block is a period of time that is devoted to similar \nmusic  each  day.    For  instance,  a  9am-Noon  period  devoted  each  weekday  to  jazz  programming  or  a \n5:30pm-6:30pm hour devoted to Public Affairs, are examples of block programming.  This block format \nmakes it much easier for listeners to tune in and know when a particular style of programming will be \naired. \nhttp://www.wmua.org/ \n\n55 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"}, {"Name": "UMassBoxingClubConstitution_Spring2017.docx", "Data": "UMass Boxing Club Constitution \nUpdated: Spring 2017 \n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nMission Statement   \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\t3\nOfficers and Responsibilities\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\t4-7\nOfficers\t4\nElections\t7\nMembership\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\t9\nMembership Eligibility\t9\nDues\t9\nVoting Rights\t9\nProcess for Member/Officer Removal \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\t10-11\nResolving Disputes\t10\nMembership Termination\t10-11\nMeeting Guidelines\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\t12\nConducting Meetings and Planning Activities\t12\nClub Records\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\t13-15\nMembership Information\t13\nAttendance\t13\t\nFinancial Records\t15\nMeeting Records\t15\nTraining and Sparring\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\t16-23\nTraining\t16\nSparring\t17\nTraining Facilities\t18\nThe Coach\t21\nSafety and Liability\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\t24-30\nLiability Documentation\t24\nApparel\t24\nSafety Guidelines\t25\nNon-Discriminatory and Freedom of Speech Clauses\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\t30\nNon-Discrimination\t31\nFreedom of Speech\t31\nAmending the Constitution\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\t32\nProposal\t32\nBibliography   \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\t33\n\n\n\n\n\nMission Statement\n\nThe UMass Boxing Club is devoted to helping its members develop self-defense skills, physical health, self-confidence and teamwork through the sport of boxing.

For this reason, having three trained safety personnel will suffice for sparring sessions. EMTs are required to be present during competitive bouts only.\n\nFrequency\nSparing will be available once a week or as frequently as the coach can accommodate.\nEach member may spar a maximum of 2 times per week with at least 24 hours rest/ recovery in between for health and safety reasons.\nOnly one pair may spar at any given time.\n\nBouts and Tournaments\nTournaments are to be organized by the coach and/or by the team captain.\nAny member wishing to enter a bout must be a member of the USA Boxing Association, must have completed the Belt Test, and must have four weeks experience with advanced training skills.\nEMTs must be made available on site at all tournaments and is the responsibility or the coach and team captain to provide these EMTs.\nBouts can be held monthly or bi-monthly; however, participants may not enter a bout if they competed less than 2 weeks prior to the current bout or tournament.\n\nTraining Facilities\n\n\n\nWestover Air Reserve Military Base\nThe Westover Air Reserve Base is a proud partner of the UMass Boxing Club. The Westover military base allows qualified club members to train in their recreation facility with Rocky Snow; however members must be escorted onto the air force base by coach Rocky Snow and remain under his supervision until being escorted off the premises. A valid form of identification is required for entry e.g. driver\u2019s license, FID, passport, etc.\nTransportation to the Westover Air Reserve Base is coordinated through two different platforms: a social media page specifically dedicated for sparring interest and activity, and a group texting system. \nGroup texts are not sent to everyone. Members must speak to the Communications Officer or Team Captain and express interest in sparring in order to be added.\nMembers in possession of a vehicle are highly encouraged to offer transportation and communicate availability through either medium or by contacting the Communications officer.\nAll trips to the Westover Air Reserve Base must be coordinated with the coach Rocky Snow.\nAccess to the Westover Air Reserve Base is prohibited without an escort from Coach Rocky Snow.\n\nEmergency Procedures\nContact the fitness center hotline (413-577-3958) to speak to the health and safety coordinator.\nFollow emergency protocol and assist with any paperwork if necessary. \nIn the case of minor injuries, apply first aid. Call 911 immediately if the injury is severe.\n\nRecreation Center\nGeneral Medical Emergency Protocol\nIf a participant is fully conscious and experiencing symptoms of low or high blood sugar, you may offer 1) glucose tablets or 2) peanut butter crackers and apple juice. It is advised to ask if they have diabetes, when was the last time they had eaten and/or if they have any food allergies. Do not hesitate to call 911 if you suspect the incident is serious or if you are unsure.\nIf someone is diabetic, they will likely be okay with taking glucose tablets and are aware of the positive impact of the glucose tablets. Please ask the participant in question if he/she is diabetic.\nIf the participant is uncomfortable taking a glucose tablet, please inform him/her that Campus Recreation has peanut butter crackers and apple juice available and ask if they would like this. Please ask if they have any allergies limiting them to taking the peanut butter crackers or apple juice.\nIf the condition of the participant does not improve upon providing peanut butter crackers/apple juice/glucose tablets, please call 911 for advanced care.\nAny medical issue is a potential emergency for the individual. Do not hesitate to call 911 if you suspect that the incident is serious or that you are unsure.\nSymptoms of low blood sugar include: confusion, dizziness, feeling shaky, hunger, headaches, irritability, weakness and anxiety. People with or without diabetes can experience low sugar symptoms.\nEssentially, symptoms for individuals with low blood sugar levels and individuals with high blood sugar levels are very similar. It has been communicated that we treat both as low blood sugar levels. Low blood sugar levels come on quick and we can fix it quick. This is the same approach used by EMTs and first responders as the application of sugar to someone with high blood sugar symptoms will not have adverse effects.\n\nDecontamination of blood spills (Recreation Center Protocol) \nFor a large spill contact Environmental Health and Safety for assistance.\nTreat all human blood and human body fluids as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, or other blood borne pathogens. Always wear protective gloves when treating any blood spills or injuries involving blood, bodily fluids, non-intact skin & mucous membranes (i.e. nose, eyes, and mouth).\nLocate the nearest blood spill kit. Blood spill kits at the recreation center can be found at the following locations: Laundry 108A, Storage 118A, Storage 121A, Storage 210B, Storage 214C, Storage 215A and Storage 310B \nAll contaminated items must be placed in the red biohazard waste bag(s). The Biohazard waste bag is available within the blood spill kit.\nUpon completion of the spill cleanup, the red biohazard waste bag must be disposed of properly in the 33 gallon red biohazard container located in Laundry 108. After placing the items in the biohazard container, please make sure the cover to the container is secure.\nPlease inform Roger Heimerman (413-577-3868) if the 33 gallon biohazard container is nearing full capacity. A service request will be placed with the EH&S to have the contents picked up and disposed of by environmental health agency.\nWash your hands immediately with soap and running water after treating any injury, including situations where gloves are worn. If running water is not available, use antiseptic wipes until you are able to wash your hands with soap and water. \nIf gloves are not immediately available during an emergency, it is highly recommended to create a large barrier between the blood and your hands. A bulky cloth or towel may be used until proper medical materials arrive. DO NOT USE BARE HANDS!\nAnyone with a soiled shirt or workout gear must discontinue participation. Do not force someone to remove something they don\u2019t want to, but the participant must be informed they cannot continue to participate in soiled clothing. If they choose to remove their soiled clothing, ask them if they want to keep it. If not, dispose of it with the rest if the clean-up materials. If they want to keep it, put the clothing in a biohazard bag for them to take with them.\nAll open wounds must be covered.\nBlood spill kits contain the following: cloth towels, paper towels, red biohazard waste bags, multi-use disinfectant spray, protective gloves, goggles, forceps, small dustpan and broom, and surgical mask.\nIn case of major injury,, immediately notify building supervisor,  Safety officers are to follow safety procedures explained below:\nEmergency services are to be called 9-1-1, CPR/AED if unresponsive and/or a possible cardiac emergency.\nIf a participant receives a significant blow to the head\nGently allow participant to lie or sit on the floor\nWatch for signs of concussion such as:\nSlurred speech\nLack of muscle coordination \nConfusion\nHeadache \nIf symptoms are evident direct to UHS and or the nearest hospital\nComplete accident/injury report, if possible assist rec center with their accident report, verify that the CSD advisor is aware of the accident/ injury and await necessary follow up instructions or actions.\nAll accidents and injuries involving bodily fluids must be cleaned as soon and as safely as possible:\nSpray contaminated surfaces with disinfectant \nApply pressure\nWipe surfaces with towels\nProperly dispose of contaminated towels\n\nBoyden Gym\nContact Dan Markowski of Boyden Gym (413-545-0075) for health and safety information.\nFollow emergency protocol and assist with any paperwork if necessary. \nIn the case of minor injuries, apply first aid.

As this is only a guideline, safety will not be sacrificed for speed. \nThe boxer has adequate access to oxygen.\nIf the boxer is being transferred by a different means, communicate with them by phone or written instructions. Be sure boxer is accompanied by reliable person, such that can be in contact with the boxer and the family of the boxer.\n\nPotential Boxing Injuries: Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nEvaluating Concussions\nA boxer temporarily stunned or knocked down and unconscious is a stricken boxer and a medical emergency. This indicates that a concussion has occurred\nA concussion is a temporarily altered state of motor hypotonus, helplessness and disturbed consciousness. \nThis includes:\nDisorientation \nMemory deficit \u2013 antegrade and retrograde amnesia \nAltered or slow speech\nDifficulty processing new information\nImpaired motor function \u2013 slow, uncoordinated\nConcussion questionnaire. Note speech \u2013 altered, slow or repetitive?\nWhat is your name?\nWhere are you?\nWhat day and year is it?\nWhat is your opponent\u2019s name? What round is it? \nAsk the boxer to repeat three words after 5 minutes.\nObserve the eyes\nPupils equal, round, reactive?\nIs there spontaneous nystagmus? The presence of spontaneous horizontal nystagmus indicates that the boxer is very vulnerable and should definitely not be permitted to continue. \nLook for facial weakness, hemiparesis or other focal signs. \nThe match should be stopped if the boxer:\nwas clearly stunned\nWas unconscious \nFails to answer the questions correctly\nFails to perform the motor tests \nShows any abnormal focal signs\n\nAbrasions\nSuch injuries often occur to the face and skull and elsewhere. \nBleeding should be halted by pressure, then cleaned and a local antiseptic applied. \n\nLacerations\nThe basic principle of handling cuts around the eye is that, if a cut causes enough bleeding to impair vision, the bout should be stopped. Most cuts will NOT require that the bout be stopped.\nDangerous Cuts:\nCuts over the supraorbital nerve or the supratrochlear nerve, if they are deep enough, may damage the nerve. \nCuts medially over the lacrimal duct area may extend into the naso-lacrimal duct. \nCuts over the infraorbital nerve, if deep enough, could damage the nerve. \nCuts on the eyelid itself could damage the tarsal plate or the globe itself may have been injured. \nVertical cuts through the vermillion border of the lip should stop the bout because of the potential for further tearing of the lip from subsequent trauma. \nCuts around or on the bridge of the nose must be carefully checked for evidence of a compound nasal fracture. If no fracture is present, the bout may be allowed to continue.\nNo dressing of cuts is allowed except for collodion or steri-\u00ad\u2010strips\n\nAddressing Nosebleeds\nThe initial evaluation should determine the presence of a fracture. Gentle handling of a nosebleed is necessary so as not to further aggravate or compound a fracture. \nIf no fracture is felt, the physician must then evaluate the character of the bleeding (i.e. venous vs. brisk arterial gushing). Bouts are stopped for arterial bleeding (rare in this situation). \n(look up how to stop a nosebleed)\nDetermination of posterior bleeding should also be done by tongue depression and pen light observation. If there are clots in the posterior pharynx or the boxer is spitting clots, the bout should be stopped. \nMassive venous bleeding may be cause to stop a bout. \nNosebleeds should stop bouts for medical reasons. \n\n\u201cBlack eye\u201d\nCold applications and light compression limit the extravasation of blood. \n\nHand fracture\nCommon fractures are those of the first metacarpal. They are primarily caused by a poor punching technique, where the thumb is not correctly positioned opposite to the index and middle fingers.\nIndicated by localized tenderness, bruising or swelling\nAll suspected hand and wrist fractures should be splinted and sent for X-\u00ad\u2010ray.\nSuspected dislocations are handled in the same fashion\n\nShoulder Dislocations\nBest relocated immediately before spasm sets in\nA sling with swathe is of benefit, but the boxer needs referral when he returns home. \n\nAbdominal Injuries\nRuptures of the organs in the abdomen (spleen, liver) are uncommon.\nPancreatitis is a remote possibility.\nKidney Contusions\nContusions may lead to massive hematuria even when no anatomic defect appears. \nPain in the abdomen and/or shoulder may signify bleeding. \n\nResponsibilities and Duties \nBoxers with head injuries should be transported to a facility with neurosurgery. \nSufficient area to examine and treat boxers who would not to be transported to a medical facility \n\nRequired Medical Equipment\nOxygen is mandatory including tubing and delivery devices. \nStretcher/backboard when EMT on site \nNo obstruction that would prevent stretcher, EMT\u2019s or Physician from moving Boxer to ambulance. \nRigid cervical collar when EMT on site\nPenlight\nGauze\nClean, disposable gloves\nAirways\nSanitizer\nBlood pressure cuff\nStethoscope\nTongue depressors\nAdhesive tape\nOphthalmoscope \nOtoscope\n\nHealth and Safety Officer\nResponsible for administering temporary aid towards injured members during both club practices and sparring.\nIn close contact and with the current facilities safety coordinator in case of an emergency. Responsible for documentation in case of an injury.\nWorks with the secretary to keep record of injuries and monitor members with existing injuries that were medically cleared to participate.\nMay also hold another executive or non-executive position in the club.\n\n\nARTICLE VIII:\nNon-Discriminatory and Freedom of Speech Clauses\n\nNon-discrimination\n\n\nThe UMass boxing club hereby vows to never deny a person membership based on race, ethnicity, political affiliation, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, income, disability, age, academic status, veteran status, mental capacity, or criminal record, unless such practices are deemed to be within the bounds of Federal and/or State law. We also vow never to exclude members from meetings, training, competitions, club events, voting rights, use of facilities, a training/sparring partner, or officer position based on the aforementioned demographics. The UMass boxing club vows to support any individual, of any demographic previously stated, in the development of their boxing career. We also vow to make reasonable accommodations to our routines and schedules for those individuals who may need it. The UMass Boxing Club shall question membership to any individual who will not adopt these vows.\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nFreedom of speech will not be limited or restricted by any officer or body of the UMass Boxing Club. A members\u2019 speech is not relevant to any proceeding conducted by the UMass boxing club. No officer or member shall use the speech of another officer or member as reason to deny or limit participation in any UMass boxing club activity.\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE IX:\nAmending the Constitution\n\nProposal\n\n\nA written proposal must be made in order for an amendment to the constitution to occur. The proposal should be sent to the president who will then schedule a meeting so that the member may defend their proposal. The proposal will be put to a vote where a two-thirds majority is required for the vote to pass. If the amendment passes then the president must add the amendment to the constitution. The amended constitution must be peer reviewed and checked for correct language before a final copy is created and made available to the club.\nAll officers must be present at the meeting\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nPrimary Source Documents\n\n\nVenegas, Brent R. \u201cBoxer\u2019s Attire and Equipment.\u201d 2008 Basic Rules and Hints for Beginning Officials, (2007): 1-5.

This is the twenty-sixth edition of those documents, which form the structural guidelines within which we, your SGA, act to serve the student body, and the University as a whole. All members of the SGA should familiarize yourselves with these documents, so you can best serve in your respective office. I want to thank you for your interest in the SGA at the University of Massachusetts \u2013Amherst.\n\t\nMy name is S\u00efonan Barrett and I have the great honor of serving as the Speaker of the Undergraduate Student Senate for the 2014-2015 academic school year. The SGA has been instrumental in helping undergraduates develop leadership skills and learn to work with others in a professional environment. The SGA has been one of the most exciting, challenging, and rewarding experiences I have had so far. Becoming a leader of smart and talented leaders is truly the greatest honor I could receive. Whether you are a senator, cabinet member, or student, I hope you can appreciate and recognize the power of the student voice and student leadership and its capabilities.\n\nMy experience within the SGA has allowed me to serve undergraduates since my freshman year within the Undergraduate Senate. From being elected as a Senator, Associate Speaker, and Speaker twice, I have grown immensely, and am continuing to grow and understand more as time goes on. Together, with our diversity of passions, backgrounds and UMass knowledge, this upcoming year looks promising. \n\nTo the senators- listen to your constituents, use your experience, and bring fresh and productive, new ideas to the Senate. If you can do so, you will be doing what leaders should: listening, designing solutions, and being willing to forge effective compromises, while not compromising your principles! Tell people what we do, and why you\u2019re proud to be a part of this change. Our role is not one of self-promotion, rather, it is one of selfless dedication to this proud University that is, and will always be, a part of our lives.\n\n\tThe University of Massachusetts at Amherst is not simply an institution of higher learning, it is our home. Be a leader, make a difference, take risks, and dare to be great. We here in the SGA do not stand on the sidelines. We have chosen, and have been chosen, to be serve our fellow students. Let\u2019s make a difference, together! \n\nS\u00efonan N.

TRUSTEE POLICY ON UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE\n\u00a0\n    A. ENDORSEMENT OF AAUP STATEMENTS ON GOVERNANCE\n1. The Board of Trustees has all authority, responsibility, rights, privileges, powers and duties of organization and government of the University of Massachusetts as provided in Chapter 75 of the General Laws of the Commonwealth. Nothing in the following statement shall be taken as contravening that authority or any applicable federal or state law or regulation; anything contravening such authority, law or regulation is void. \n2. Nevertheless, as an established university discharges its obligations and responsibilities to society by the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, the variety and complexity of its tasks require and ensure the interdependence of the governing board, the administration, the faculty, and the students, as well as other groups. The Board of Trustees has long recognized this interdependence, both among campuses within the system and among the various components within a campus, and now formally adopts the principle of joint effort in governing the University.\n3. Join effort in University governance will take a variety of forms depending on the issue and the situation. The administrative officers or the Board may in some instances propose recommendations for the consideration of the faculty and/or students before taking final action. The faculty and/or students may in other instances propose recommendations subject only to the endorsement of the administration and the Board. In all instances, however, the principle of joint effort requires that components within the University remain sensitive to the interests of other components.\n4. The Board of Trustees therefore endorses in principle the 1996 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities adopted by the American Association of University Professors, the American Council of Education, and the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges and the 1970 statement on Student Participation in College and University Government formulated by the three aforementioned organizations, insofar as both are consistent with this Trustees\u2019 Statement on University Governance. In endorsing these two statements, the Board, while retaining its ultimate legal authority in governing the University, recognizes that the faculty, the students, and other groups within the University have the right, the responsibility, and the privilege of advising on policies affecting the University. The Board will ensure these rights, responsibilities, and privileges through the various governing bodies\u2014both representative bodies such as senates and assemblies, and administrative bodies such as departments, school, and colleges\u2014established by its bylaws and other actions.\nB. PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES IN GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Board of Trustees recognizes that while it must exercise general authority over the University, certain components of the University, such as the President\u2019s Office, the campus administrations, and the representative and administrative governing bodies of the faculty and the students have, by virtue of interest, training, and experience, a special concern and competence in certain areas. Subject to precedents established by components on each campus and/or the restraints and procedures specified in their constitutions, these components shall have primary responsibility in their areas of special competence and concern. Whenever the phrase \"primary responsibility\" appears in this statement, it shall mean the capacity to initiate recommendations, after appropriate consultation, in accordance with the procedures specified in section II. D below. Such recommendations will be overruled only by written reasons stated in detail. While it in no way is intended to contravene the authority and participation of the Board of Trustees in governance, the following is a general statement of primary responsibility in the major areas of University life. \nACADEMIC MATTERS: By virtue of its professional preparation and its central concern with learning and teaching the faculty will exercise primary responsibility in such academic matters as curriculum, subject matter and methods of instruction, research, admissions, libraries, and other aspects of University life which directly relate to the educational process. Students share this concern and they will be assured the opportunity of participating in developing academic policies and in evaluating degrees, programs, and courses.\u00a0 \nFACULTY STATUS: The faculty will have primary responsibility for matters of faculty status, such as appointments, reappointments, promotions, tenure, and salary adjustments. Students will also be assured the opportunity of participating in the evaluation of a faculty member\u2019s effectiveness. \nSTUDENT AFFAIRS: Students will have primary responsibility for services and activities which are designed primarily to serve students or those which are financed primarily by students, managing student political affairs and organizational matters, and setting standards for student behavior, conduct, and discipline. \nPLANNING, DEVELOPMENT AND BUDGET: The President is responsible for exerting educational leadership in the planning and development of the University, both before the Board of Trustees and on the various campuses. He/she shall coordinate the planning and development on the separate campuses, keep current a University master plan, and ensure that all appropriate components of the University have the opportunity to make recommendations before planning and development decisions are rendered. The President is also responsible for coordinating, preparing, and presenting to the Board of Trustees the University\u2019s annual budget request. He/she shall represent the budget request approved by the Board to the Governor and the General court. The Chancellors are responsible for coordinating, preparing, and presenting to the President budget requests from the campuses. The President is responsible for continually improving the budget process and developing a calendar which allows adequate time for consultation and study by all interested components of the University.\nII. RESPONSIBILITIES, DUTIES, FUNCTIONS, AND PROCEDURES OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, THE PRESIDENT, THE CAMPUS ADMINISTRATORS, AND THE CAMPUS GOVERNING BODIES IN UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE\nConsistent with Chapter 15A and pursuant to Chapter 75 of the General Laws of the Commonwealth, the Board of Trustees may establish general policies governing the University.

Though the handbook is primarily designed as an introduction for first-semester employees, it also serves as the only written record of all store policies and procedures. Therefore, copies of the handbook may be given to returning co-managers each semester as a reference for company policies and individual responsibilities. A copy of the handbook should also be present at every all-staff for the same reasons.  Finally, this handbook is the only official history of CD&C and is a vital means of passing on information from one generation of co-managers to the next.  The book is a \u201cliving\u201d document, altered in accordance with formal changes in the business.\n\nThe CD&C handbook is organized into six distinct sections designed according to the requirements of the Center for Student Business and for your reading pleasure: HISTORY AND IDEY provides the story of our business from its conception through the present.  A discussion of cooperative ideologies is vital in order to understand the CD&C management style.  Additionally, the role of the Center for Student Businesses and its staff is explained. The ALL-STAFF section details the format and content of weekly business meetings, including the decision-making process and policies on attendance.  COMMITTEES explain how the tasks of running the business are divided and assigned to individual and groups of co-managers.  In addition to listing the descriptions and responsibilities of each committee, this section lays out committee election processes.  PERSONNEL encompasses human resource particulars: hiring and firing, attendance policies, the stars-n-dots system of accountability, and co-worker evaluations. Lastly,  BUSINESS AND FINANCE presents an overview of the financial philosophies of CD&C. This section has been designed to give non-business majors basic knowledge of the not-for-profit system and outlines the UMass purchase order system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART I\nHISTORY AND IDEOLOGY\n\nMISSION STATEMENT\nCampus Design and Copy is an undergraduate student-initiated and managed business at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Its purpose is three-fold: \n\nTo provide undergraduate students with experience and training in collective management; to serve the University community with copying, design, binding, faxing, computer and finishing services; and to promote the co-operative and collective movements. It aims to foster ideals of equality and diversity in the workplace. CD&C is a not-for-profit organization and operates under the model \u201cstudents working for students.\u201d\n\nIN THE BEGINNING\u2026\nCampus Design and Copy was born on January 10, 1990, when a decision was made by representatives of the SGA and the Center for Student Businesses to merge SGA Communications with the Student Notes and Printing Services (SNPS) to create a student business. Both SNPS and SGA Communications were failing and needed assistance.  The SGA could no longer afford to support such an expensive graphics service, and SNPS was not getting enough business to keep it alive. To the Univeristy, the decision to merge these two organizations seemed like a gamble, but the folks involved believed the new business would thrive with a little hard work from dedicated students. A collectively-run student business serving the University community and providing a \u201cworking classroom\u201d for its co-managers was established.\n\nThe kinds of services offered by CD&C have significantly evolved since its inception. Initially, co-managers were paid to sit in lectures and take notes, which were then reproduced and sold to students. This service was discontinued soon after the merger, as the business began to focus on the more lucrative product of academic packets. Class notes are still a CD&C service, but in the form of \u201ccourse packets,\u201d notes/hand-outs provided by professors or teaching assistants. CD&C has increasingly emphasized working directly with RSO\u2019s (Registered Student Organizations) and presently relies on RSO revenue for a significant part of its income. In addition to copying, many RSO\u2019s take advantage of the business' graphic design services to create invitations, pamphlets, flyers, etc.  With advances in technology, CD&C has continually updated its computer and networking systems and expanded its design services. In addition to CD&C designed graphics, personal computer use is offered to student groups and individual students. The addition of the store\u2019s fax machine in 2006 and new printers and computers acquired in 2010 are examples of CD&C\u2019s commitment to expanding its services to meet the changing needs of the UMass community.\n\nCD&C has also experienced a number of structure and policy changes over the years. Many of the initial changes occurred during fall semester of 1994, a time which marked a major turning point for the business and which accounts for the significance of this very handbook. The business was unprecedentedly unprepared for a new semester. Without a foundation to run on, the returning staff \u2013 consisting primarily of inexperienced second semester comanagers and nine new hires \u2013 were forced to restructure the business from scratch. These forefathers conceived new committees, procedures, and policies that led us to where we are today.\nIn early 1996, the business experienced three important changes.  First was a restructuring and beautification of the business\u2019 office space. Second was acquisition of a new and updated Xerox copying machine.  And finally, after months of leg-work by CD&C employees, the business received a $5,000.00 grant from the Xerox Corporation in order to fund two new computers and a laser printer.  In February of that year, a grand re-opening was held to publicize this grant and to draw attention to CD&C\u2019s status as a student-run business (see accompanying Collegian article).  \n\nIn the spring of 2002 CD&C went through another major change when the process of updating the major copying equipment was raised and research began. By the closing of winter 2002 CD&C decided to renegotiate and extend their current contract with IKON; the result was the arrival of two new Canon copiers at a fraction of the cost. The new copiers enabled CD&C to expand its networking capabilities, decreasing the cost of computer printouts with copiers replacing the use of the laser printers. Shortly after, in fall of 2003, the vision of CD&C being a major color copy provider realized with the purchase of a new color copier. This purchase opened up new possibilities for the expansion of CD&C graphic and design services. CD&C has since negotiated the conversion of the color copier rental agreement over to a more beneficial leasing agreement and also researching the possible updating of CD&C self-serve copier. \n\nThe year 2006 has brought forth numerous valuable changes in CD&C. As a result in the fall of 2006, due to substantial decreasing change in revenue, we saw fit to permanently reduce the number of co-managers in our business.  Other changes included the addition of a public bulletin board and the transition from RSO IAR cards to computer spreadsheets. CD&C updated and pioneered numerous sources of profitable revenue to our business with these innovative  changes.\n\n(Somewhere in here, OCE happened.)\n\nCD&C experienced many major changes during the 2010-2011 academic year. Technologically speaking, we gained a bureaucratically enforced lease agreement with XEROX and two new printers. Against all odds, CD&C also bought two new computers. On the business side of matters, we concluded that our dot policy required restructuring. After consulting other student-run businesses with effective dot policies, a new dot policy was voted into existence in January of 2011. \n\n\nWHAT IS A CO-OP? \nCD&C is considered a \u201cco-operative\u201d business (\u201cco-op\u201d) in the sense that we manage the business according to co-operative ideologies. Although we control our own capital, UMass ultimately owns CD&C and so we are technically a collectively-run business. However, CD&C is strongly based principles of a co-operative and we generally use words like \u201ccooperative\u201d and \u201ccollective\u201d interchangeably to describe ourselves.\n\nThe first cooperative was formed in  in 1844 by one woman and 27 men, who would become known as the \u201cRochdale Pioneers.\u201d  This group of people put together a set of principles that all co-ops use.  The Rochdale Principles are as follows:\n\n1.\tOpen Membership: Membership to the co-op is voluntary and there is no discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or religious or political affiliation. \n2.\tDemocratic Control: One member, one vote.  This principle guards \t against control by the few for the benefit of the few.\n3.\tLimited Return on Equity Capital: Money made is re-invested in the business.\n4. Net-Surplus Belongs to User-Owners: The net savings of a co-op may be distributed equitably among the membership, or used in some other agreed upon manner, either for the benefit of the group or for the local community as a whole.\n5.\tContinuous Education: Co-ops act to educate their members and the local community about the principles, methods, problems and goals of the organization.\n6.\tCooperation among Cooperatives: To strengthen themselves and to serve members and the community better, co-ops need to work together at the local, regional, national and international levels.\nPolitical Non-Partisanship: Adhering to the goals of a particular political party or agenda would limit membership, thus violating the open membership principle. This does not mean that co-ops must be politically inactive, but it does mean that co-ops have usually chosen to limit their political activity to those issues directly effecting the co-op movement and the industries they are a part of.\n\nWHAT IS A ECTIVE?\nAs previously stated, UMass ultimately owns CD&C, and this prevents the business from being a true co-operative.  Philosophically we operate under the principles of a co-op, and operate as worker-run collective. A collective is very much like a co-op; while Co-ops often operate on the basis of majority rule, collectives are characterized by collective decision-making and commitment to empowering the people who do the work. Nearly all of the co-operative Rochdale Principles apply to CD&C despite the fact that we only own our business in spirit.  For example, every member can exercise decision making power equal to any other member and profits are reinvested into the business.  Additionally, we attempt to educate our members and customers about the ideas of collectives and cooperatives.  We enforce policies of non-discrimination and membership is open to all UMass undergrads. However, CD&C does not have completely open membership because potential members must apply and be selected by the Hiring Committee.  \n\nWHAT IS PCIPATORY MANAGEMENT?\nWHAT IS CNSUS DECISION MAKING?\nA collective can have a number of different management structures; in the case of CD&C, the business is run under what is called \u201cparticipatory management.\u201d  Participatory management is as a management style in which all members have an equal say in business decisions; one member, one vote.  There is no hierarchical structure.  The tasks of running the business are broken down and delegated to different committees.  This promotes an emphasis on group development and team building.  All decisions are made by consensus.  This means that before a decision can be implemented all members of the collective must consent to the decision.  Consensus decision making is an alternative to the usual \u201cmajority rules\u201d model of most groups and is based on the idea of unity.  Instead of a minimum of 51% of the group agreeing, consensus requires that no member object to the decision.  In effect, there is a lot of give and pull and compromise until everyone is satisfied with the decision made.  This type of decision making prevents a majority from ruling over a minority and ensures that every individual has the opportunity to contribute.  However, it should be understood that not everyone will be totally satisfied with the final outcome; this is rare; for this reason, abstentions are allowed.  The consensus process is often frustrating and time-consuming, but it can also be extremely rewarding as it requires tolerance and respect for the opinions of others. For further explanation of CD&C\u2019s decision-making process, see \u201cDecision-Making at All-Staff\u201d\n\nTHE CENTER FOR STUDENT BUSINESS\n\tThe Center For Student Business (CSB) provides guidance, training, and oversight for the University\u2019s eight student-run businesses.  The CSB is the primary link between businesses like CD&C and the University administration.  The office assists CD&C with budgets, income statements and other financial matters.  The CSB provides a consultant for each student business, an undergraduate SOM major, who attends the All-Staff meetings and educates the group about the fiscal side of the business. \n\nINFRA-STRUCTURE\n\u2022 Head Coordinator \u2013 Rosemary Schmidt \n\tRosemary is the head of the CSB. She oversees all student controlled businesses. Look to her for information on collective history, business advice, problem-solving consultation, and CD&C history. She can be contacted in her office at the CSB, 409 Student Union, or called at 545-2166.\n\u2022 Assistant Coordinator- Amy Helstowski\n\tThis individual plays an enormous role at CD&C. He/she deals with our financial transactions, working with the consultant to create a sound, workable budget. The Assistant Coordinator will also attend and participate in All-staff and Steering committee meetings. This person also plays a large role in educating CD&C on more effective ways of streamlining inefficiencies and productive team management. \t\n\u2022 CSB Consultant\nThe CSB Consultant is an ISOM student working for us in the CSB. He/she is responsible for creating a sound and workable budget for each semester. Once it is completed he/she presents it to the group at an All-Staff meeting. This person also provides us with monthly income statement reviews, consultation advice, and directs the activities for the individual members of CD&C\u2019s business committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART II:\nALL-STAFF MEETINGS\n\nWhat is All-Staff?\nCommunication is the essence of CD&C. During weekly All-Staff meetings, all co-managers and the CSB consultant meet to communicate about various issues and ideas and to make collective decisions; individuals and committees exchange information with the rest of the business (usually through committee reports) and progress on certain tasks is reported.  Meetings can also turn into mini-brainstorming sessions in which co-managers can respectfully discuss ideas for improving the business.  Occasionally there are special speakers and/or workshops held during All-Staff. For obvious reasons, All-Staff meetings are mandatory.  If an employee has a class conflict, this matter must be brought to the attention of the All-Staff as soon as possible.  \n\nEach co-manager has 2 free/missed meetings per semester - no questions asked.  However, it is advisable that these 2 misses be saved for dire academic or health circumstances.  If an employee is going to miss a meeting, he/she is responsible for putting their name on the agenda under \u201cMembers Absent\u201d before the agenda is copied. After the 2nd free miss, any subsequent absences are inexcusable (illness, unless serious, is not an excuse if the employee has already missed 2 meetings - see the section entitled \u201cIf you missed the meeting...\u201d).  Anyone missing a meeting forfeits his/her right to vote on any matter decided upon in that All-Staff.  Ideally, meetings take place on Monday evenings and usually last about two hours, but can stretch longer for special discussions including committee elections or workshops. \n\nIf school is cancelled on a Monday and the next day is a Tuesday schedule, then All-Staff will still be held that Monday. If school is cancelled but the next day is a Monday schedule, then CD&C follows a Monday schedule and Tuesday is when All-Staff will be held. This also applies with shift hours and other committee meetings that would fall on a Monday. When school is cancelled the whole day of after a certain time due to inclement weather, scheduled holidays, or other types of emergency closing CD&C will be closed as well. The same applies for late opening of the campus; CD&C will follow the late-closing schedule.\n\n\nAll-Staff s\n(All roles are assigned on the critical info center at the beginning of each semester on a rotating schedule.)\nFACILITATOR\nThe facilitator is responsible for guiding the All-Staff meeting: starting the meeting on time, assigning roles, and organizing the agenda. Additionally, the facilitator assists the group in determining what it is they want to accomplish and helps to carry it out by initiating discussion and carrying out votes to test for consensus. The facilitator should attempt to summarize and convey confusing or controversial ideas expressed by employees. It is also the responsibility of the facilitator to objectively diffuse emotional tension between co-mangers. The facilitator should be informed of the issues to be discussed, provide copies of the agenda and all-staff materials to all employees, and is responsible for starting the meeting promptly. The facilitator should also be aware of follow-through assignments from the previous meeting. In order to have an objective perspective, he or she should have little emotional involvement and/or investment in the meeting and remain professional at all times. Lastly, the facilitator is responsible for encouraging discussion amongst all employees to better insure the quality of the decision made. (Material adapted from Katja Hahn D\u2019Errico\u2019s How To Facilitate a Meeting, 1994.) The facilitator is also responsible for putting the agenda and any proposals/trainings in the all-staff binder. \n\nNOTETAKER\nThe notetaker in the All-Staff meeting records what is said and done at each meeting. Because these notes are the only record of what is currently going on at CD&C and serve as a written history, the notetaker must type up the notes and file them (along with all corresponding all-staff materials) in the appropriate folders on the critical information board.\n\nTIMEKEEPER\nThe timekeeper position serves to keep the meeting functioning at an efficient pace. He/she makes sure the meeting follows the estimated times for each agenda item closely, allowing more time for important items and reminding co-managers of the time already spent on less important items. \n\nSTACKER\nThe stacker keeps the flow of the meeting at a continuous pace by discreetly \u2018stacking\u2019 speakers in order when there is more than one co-manager who would like contribute. For the sake of equality, stackers have the option to tally the amount of times each co-manager speaks and verbalize the numbers.\n\nHow Meetings Are Run\nBefore All-Staff it is the responsibility of each co-manager to mark on the master Agenda whether they have any topics to discuss during the meeting, whether they will be absent, late, etc. If you cannot do it yourself, tell someone who will be able to mark it before copies of the agenda are made. It is the role of a steering committee member to mark who is the facilitator, note taker, stacker, and timekeeper. \n\nThe All-Staff meeting is run according to the following format:\n\n\tI.  BEGINNING GO-AROUND\nDuring this time each co-manager has a few moments to express how their week has been going, what they did that weekend, announce any personal news, etc. Co-managers also answer a question, provided by Steering, which allows co-managers to express their personalities. The first fifteen minutes of each all-staff is reserved for this function, allowing co-managers to get to know each other in a personal level.\n\n\tII. FOLLOW-THROUGH\n\tThis is a list of tasks, read out loud, that was assigned at the previous meeting. Large Follow through items (Designing a banner for the store, performing a profit analysis) should be written down and put on the corkboard board in the store with its desired completion date. It can also be written in the logbook, and the communications co-manager can send a reminder email depending on the urgency and size of the job. Smaller tasks should be completed during the week either by the co-manager or committee it was assigned to (Did register get fixed?  Are the new payroll forms ready?).  If the task was not completed, the person and/or committee can be given dots by the Steering Committee. Its purpose is to allow All-Staff to hold people and committees accountable for jobs to be done.\n\n\tIII. DO\u2019S AND \u2019TS, S AND DOTS, EMPLOYEE OF THE WEEK.\nThe system of \u201cDo\u2019s and Don\u2019ts\u201d encourages co-managers to formally remind each other of various store-related conventions. Its purpose is to prevent sloppiness and attention to relevant procedures and policies. Co-managers can use Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts to address issues that arise during day to day store operations. Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts consist of slips of paper (respectively labeled either \u201cDo\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d) upon which any co-manager may write a pertinent reminder to be vocalized at the following All-Staff. At this time, Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts may also be verbally added. \n If you notice some protocol in the store was neglected or identify a policy that you feel needs to be reiterated, the Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts system enables you to do so anonymously. At any point during the week you may simply record a \u201cDo\u201d or a \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d and deposit it in the \u201cDo\u2019s and Don\u2019ts\u201d box. (e.g. DO: clean up scraps of paper after chopping; DON\u2019T: forget to mark an email as unread if you opened it but did not respond)\n\t\u201cStars and Dots\u201d characterize our system of accountability. Stars are given to co-managers when they go above and beyond basic duties or when they exhibit exemplary qualities which benefit the business. Any co-manager can give any other co-manager a Star at any point in time; the limit of Stars bestowed upon a given co-manager is infinity. If you feel as though a co-manager deserves a Star, fill out a \u201cStar\u201d slip and deposit the slip into the Star/Dot box with your name, the name of the co-manager receiving the Star, the date the Star was given, and, you guessed it, the reason for giving the Star. In the event that a co-manager earns multiple Stars for the same reason, only one of the Stars shall be counted. Stars are read at All-Staff and immediately posted by steering on the \u201cStar chart\u201d (located on the Critical Info board). \n\tDots are given to co-managers when they fail to carry out a designated duty. Dots can be given to any co-manager by any co-manager at any point in time. Unlike stars, a list of specific \u201cdottable offenses\u201d (located on the Critical Info board) serves as a guideline by which to determine what shortcomings deserve recognition. If a co-manager has committed an offense worthy of a dot that also complies with the established dottable offenses, then they should receive a Dot (or give themselves a Dot). However, Dot-worthy transgressions are not limited to the formal list of \u201cdottable offenses\u201d and a co-manager can give another co-manager a Dot when they feel it is appropriate. To dot a co-manager, fill out a \u201cDot\u201d slip with the appropriate information (your name, name of recipient, incident of importance, date) and deposit the slip into the \u201cStar and Dot\u201d box. In order for a Dot to be considered official, the Dot-giver MUST discuss the situation and Dot with the Dot-recipient before it is read at the next All-Staff. Dots may be formally disputed; if a co-manager believes themselves undeserving of a particular Dot - for any reason \u2013 they should address the Steering Committee with concerns and the issue will be dealt with. All dots are recorded immediately after All staff and can be viewed on the \u201cDot\u201d chart located on the \u201cCritical Info\u201d wall. \n\tAn \u201cEmployee of the Week\u201d is voted on silently at each all-staff and announced at the end of all-staff. Being elected employee of the week is a great honor and the winner receives a star for their exemplary performance. \t\n\nIV. COMMITTEE GO-AROUND\n\tCommittee go-arounds provide an opportunity for the members of each committee to update the business on prevalent happenings. Committees report in accordance with the order they are written in on the agenda.  \n\n\tV. AGENDA \n\tAt this point in the meeting all discussions, proposals, elections and special presentations take place. Any sensitive or controversial proposals should be brought to the attention of the Steering Committee and facilitator beforehand.  The contents of the agenda are decided on before the meeting starts. Employees have the opportunity to add to the agenda during the week as new or old issues arise. Each agenda item should include the employee\u2019s name, subject matter and estimated duration of discussion (see \u201cAll-Staff Roles\u201d section titled \u201cTimekeeper\u201d).  Any issue that does not come to a definite resolution is placed on the Follow-Through list and on next week\u2019s agenda for further evaluation.\n\n\tVI. CLOSING REMARKS AND FOLLOW THROUGH\n\tThis is where any formerly forgotten items are stated and a summary of the meeting is read by the Notetaker.\n\nDecision-Making at All-Staff\nPROPOSALS\n\tAny co-manager or committee can submit a proposal for the business to adopt. There are two types of proposals: \n\n1.  Proposals entailing a specific change in CD&C policy (i.e. an amendment to the Dot policy, the expansion of a committee, etc.).  If passed, this type of proposal immediately becomes official policy and is added to the handbook.\n2. \tProposals that do not directly affect business policy. Examples include: purchasing new equipment or spending money on an expensive advertising campaign. \n(Please note that effective proposals are generally proportionate in length  and scope to the importance and/or cost of the point up for discussion).     \n\n\t\tThe first step in the \u201cproposal process\u201d is to put the proposal on the agenda. At the beginning of the All-Staff meeting typed copies of the proposal should be given to each employee. The written proposal must include a title, name(s) of the proposer(s), and the date, specific reasons for the proposal, expected impact(s) on the business, expected costs (if applicable), and should name all areas of the business that would be effected.  \n\t\t*Please make sure to include a copy of the proposal in the proposal binder regardless of whether the proposal passes or fails. The proposal binder is useful for co-managers at the beginning of the proposal-writing process to reference to see what types of proposals have been introduced in the past, what passed, and what didn't fly. Much can be learned from former proposals!\nDISCUSSION\n\tWhen time comes to discuss the proposal in question, the proposer(s) read the proposal aloud. The floor is then opened so that all members can ask clarifying questions or state opinions and reasons supporting those opinions. All those who want to speak should raise their hands and wait for the Stacker to call on them.  Employees should try not to be redundant, and should use the phrase \u201cpiggyback\u201d of \u201csecond\u201d when possible (e.g. \u201cI piggyback what Alexa said\u201d). The facilitator is indispensable during this discussion period. The facilitator must make sure everyone\u2019s voice is heard, but he/she must also prevent the discussion from becoming a free-for-all, or from going around in circles.  When the facilitator feels that all points of view have been aired, he/she cuts off the discussion and should take a poll to see if the group appears ready to make a decision; if so, the facilitator calls for a vote (see below).  If, on the other hand, the group is still unsure of the proposal and/or there are some issues which still need to be cleared up, the facilitator either takes a vote to continue the discussion or puts the proposal on next week\u2019s agenda and/or follow through list.\nDECISIONS / TEST FOR CONSENSUS\n\tCD&C prides itself on consensus decision making. Every co-manager has an equal say in every decision. The facilitator begins the voting process by asking for those opposed to the proposal to raise their hands, followed by those who want to abstain, and those in support of a decision. In the interest of providing training and maintaining stability at CD&C, new hires are not allowed to vote for their first four All-Staffs. \n\t\nThere are three ways to vote for a proposal using the model of consensus-based decision-making:\n1. A YEA (pronounced \u201cYAY\u201d) is appropriate if you support the proposal in question. \n2. An abstain provides the option to abstain from voting if you do not directly oppose the proposal in question but do not feel comfortable endorsing the proposal either. Situations appropriate for an abstain include: you wrote the proposal and feel you are biased; the proposal applies to a semester in which you will no longer be a co-manager at CD&C; you feel ambivalent and cannot decide.\n3. A NAY stops the proposal from moving along any further. If even one co-manager votes this way the proposal is immediately stopped and will not pass during that meeting. Once a 'nay' vote is made the co-managers discuss and decide whether the person(s) voting this way will be held accountable for preparing a counter-proposal or not. Please be aware that there is an expectation that if you vote 'nay' you are thusly prepared to write a counter-proposal, or can provide a substantial alternative. A counter-proposal is not a distinct requirement of the 'nay' vote because with this there could be the possibility of major filibustering. The point of a 'nay' vote is not to stall progress but to truly express your opinion concerning proposals. \n\nDuring a meeting the first step is to test for consensus. This entails the facilitator saying \"Any opposed to the proposal as it stands?\"-this is the time for 'nay' votes to raise their hands. If there are no objections then the call for abstaining votes is given, at which point abstinent co-managers raise their hands. Finally, those in favor of the proposal as it stands raise their hands. \n\nAfter the votes are counted, 'abstain' and 'nay' voters are given time to explain their reasoning. Comments should be concise. If one half or more of the co-op abstains from voting on a proposal then the co-managers will decide whether to let the proposal pass, table it, or have co-managers volunteer to write a counter-proposal to be ready by next all-staff.\n\nIf You Miss The Meeting...\nBecause All-Staff meetings are essential to the daily operations of our business, attendance is mandatory. However, there are certain instances in which employees are not able to make meetings for various reasons whether they are related to academics or to illnesses. Therefore, CD&C adopted the policy which allows for two absences per semester. If an employee misses more than two meetings, he or she must give specific reasons to validate the absence and may be given dots and/or called before the Steering Committee. If an employee does miss a meeting, he/she is not only responsible for reading all of the notes of the meeting, but also to confer with other employees regarding issues discussed at the meeting. If an employee is going to miss a meeting, he/she is responsible for putting their name on the agenda under \u201cMembers Absent\u201d before the agenda is copied. This is kept track of in the Steering binder, and will also be recorded on the agenda for the meeting, which is also saved in the same binder. It is advisable that co-managers keep a record of the all-staff agendas for their personal records to refer back to from time to time as well. \n\nFIRST ALL STAFF MANDATORY ATTENDANCE POLICY\nIt is critical to CD&C that all co-managers attend the first All Staff of each semester. This meeting is mandatory, so there is a strict discipline policy for excessive tardiness for this meeting. If someone is tardy without excise, it warrants one dot for every thirty minutes late.\n\nPART III:\nCOMMITTEES: THE HEART OF CD&C\nCommittees are integral to carrying out the various responsibilities to operate Campus Design\nand Copy.  It is in committee work where employees can contribute the most to the success of\nCD&C.  This is not to downplay the importance of shift work, but most employees put in more\nhours doing committee work than shifts. The responsibilities of committee members include\nmeeting deadlines, taking on different duties, following up and reporting on these duties at all\nstaff, and most importantly, maintaining strong lines of communication with the customers and\nthe CD&C staff members.  All full-time committees must meet weekly at a designated time,\npreferably outside of CD&C if the meeting time is during business hours (this is mandatory for the\nsteering committee). They report back their progress, ideas, decisions, proposals, etc. at each all\nstaff meeting during \u201cCommittee Go-Around.\u201d During the first meeting of the semester, each\ncommittee must create a list of long and short term goals that the committee wants to accomplish.\nThis list is given to Steering, who then tries to assist the different committees in fulfilling these\ngoals. Committee hours are paid like shift hours, and for financial reasons, membership is limited\nto a certain number for each committee. Non-members may sit-in on meetings and contribute\ntheir ideas. However, they will not be paid for this time. Committee membership is a great deal of\nresponsibility and should be taken seriously. For this reason, committee membership is voted on\nnear the end of each semester generally at an all-staff.  \n\nCOMMITTEE ELECTIONS\nElections are held at the end of each semester during an all-staff for the coming semester. The election process is run by members of the Steering Committee. Anyone can run for any committee, yet the idea of \u201ccommittee continuity\u201d is extremely important to the success of committees and CD&C as a whole.  That is, it is essential that committee membership from semester to semester overlap so that there is a smooth transfer of knowledge from older co-managers to new committee members.  Co-managers are voted onto committees for one semester at a time, with the exception of the bookkeeper, the and also the Steering, Academic and Hiring Committees, which are two semester commitments. Elections should be done at least two weeks before the end of the semester so that there is ample time to prepare, make timelines etc. for next semester. In accordance with the 1/15 policy (as it was named when 15 people were in the co-op), all first semester employees are required to be on one full-time committee, while all employees with one semester\u2019s experience are required to serve on two committees, one of which must be designated full-time. Either Steering or the whole store will discuss the appropriate number of co-managers needed per committee and business designation if it becomes an issue. The election process is outlined on the following page.\n\nELECTION PROCESS\n1.  Each committee is written on the board with the number of positions open listed. When the name of the committee is announced by Steering, nominations are taken. \n2.  Each employee running for a spot on the committee takes a little time to state why they are running. \n3.  If an election is contested (meaning that there are more people running than slots available), employees running for the committee must leave the room, and an open discussion on the candidates take place. When discussion is over, silent votes are taken on paper and the results are read immediately after each committee election.  This provides those people who did not make it onto a committee the opportunity to run for another committee.\n4.  Committee slots that are not filled during the election process are reopened during the beginning of the coming semester and this process is repeated on a smaller scale.  Empty positions are usually filled by new employees.\n\t\nAgain, no one will be banned from a committee. If an employee does not make it by election and stills want to participate, they should feel free to attend meetings. However, they will not be paid for that time because they are not officially on the committee. \n\t\nCertain committees have a two semester commitment; those are BOSB and Steering. After two semesters of committee work have been completed an employee may be reelected onto the committee but must be reelected for each semester following. New hires are limited to certain committees.  \n\nACADEMIC COMMITTEE\n4/5 ELECTED MEMBERS (IDEALLY WITH 2 RETURNING MEMBERS)\n The main goal of the Academic committee is to orchestrate the production of academic packets. It all starts with talking to professors and getting their copies of what they would like the packets to be. If their packets have material that is copyrighted, it is the duty of a lovely member or two of the committee to procure the needed rights from Copyright.com. The professor then signs off on a proof of the packet, and the packet is printed and priced using the CD&C packet pricing template. This committee requires co-managers with good communication skills, willingness to talk on the phone, through, email, and in person with (oftentimes) persnickety professors, and an interest in copyright procedure. People on academic must also be prepared to deal with unjamming machines and willing to spend a substantial amount of time in the store making packets during that infamous period of time at the start of each semester called \u201cRush\u201d. There is a fair amount of academic packet work done over the summer and winter as well, so someone with an open schedule and availability to come into the store during break would be ideal for a position within this committee. \n\nFor the future academic hopes to evolve, and include printed course notes and professor powerpoint print-outs for sale to students in large lecture classes. \n\nMARKETING COMMITTEE\n\nADVERTISING\n\tTo promote the business via various methods of advertising by developing new ways to expand our visibility to customers by marketing our capabilities;  to work independently and also along with the design committee creating and setting an agenda for flyering on campus;  all the while ensuring the longevity of our collective through traditional and innovative methods of advertising.   \n\nREQUIREMENTS AND DUTIES:\nCreate a focused marketing plan for the semester using specific, coordinated campaigns.  Early in the semester committee members should decide what areas of the University they want to target and how they plan to advertise to these groups.\n  Work with the Board of Student Businesses to do cross promoting with other RSOs and student businesses. Some examples would be placing an ad in Guild play programs and attaching a CD&C coupon to a snack bar flyer.\nMaintain consistency in advertising (i.e. Use similar logos and fonts within a given ad. (Campaign when designing brochures or flyers for that campaign.)\nTarget specific areas: SOM, LGRC, FAC, dining halls, , Student Union, etc.\nUnder advice of CSB accountant, devise a budget for the semester, indicating what costs are expected for proposed advertising campaigns.  \nDesign, and display flyers and brochures. Marketing should coordinate with the Design Committee to create these advertisements.  CD&C has some standard brochures to display and mail out, but because our services are constantly expanding, these ads often need to be updated. (CD&C\u2019s address, fax & phone number, and store hours should be placed on each flyer)\nAssist the Hiring Committee in creating and distributing attractive \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d flyers in the first 2 weeks of the semester, when we are hiring.\nDesign attractive and professional in-store displays and signs.\n\nDESIGN COMMITTEE \n\nDESIGN \n\tTo involve the client in every step of designing their vision; to be committed to providing a final product that is as reflective of the client\u2019s concepts as is possible. It is essential that the client feels comfortable with every step of the process of taking their ideas and getting them in print. To strive to integrate our individual talents and styles into every piece of work we create, while staying true to the intentions and wishes of the customer. In store, Design is committed to keeping internal documents and templates stylish, current, and efficient. \n\nREQUIREMENTS & DUTIES\nDivide and complete design jobs between members as quickly and professionally as possible\nMaintain the hard drive of the computers and ensure that design jobs (and other folders) are catalogued effectively. Delete all unnecessary files at the end of every two months (twice a semester) in order to keep the computers running smoothly.\nInvestigate the purchase of computer equipment, software and accessories when needed.  All recommendations for new purchases should be forwarded to the Business Committee, Steering and All-Staff. \nMaintain a Design Book for customers to browse. Update frequently.   \n\nFREQUENT FLYERING\nThree (or four or more) co-managers will be designated as frequent flyer-ers to ensure that the flyers that need to fly get flown. The other members of the Design Committee will be on stand by to fill in in case any of the normal flyer-ers cannot fulfill their duties. \n\nThe goal is to flyer on every available bulletin on campus for a fee.  In addition, the committee members are also responsible for delivering flyers to the Berkshire House for them to be distributed to dorms.  The flyer-ers will also post Campus Design &Copy flyers along with our clients' flyers as an additional source of revenue.\n\t\tIn order to avoid possible conflicts, an agreement was made for the client to sign which nullifies liability to Campus Design and Copy for covered, damaged, or ripped down flyers. The price per building is no-negotiable and is set by the flyering committee alone. This committee must flyer CD&C advertisements every month, preferably at the beginning to assure maximum exposure. \n\nBOARD OF STUDENT BUSINESSES\n2 ELECTED MEMBERS \nThe Board (BOSB) was created in 1994 in order to bring together the student-run businesses at UMass.  This group functions as a tool for all the businesses, acting as the middle-man between the businesses and University officials. BOSB establishes a formal network for the student business community; representatives from each of the student businesses meet weekly to share information and insure that each of the businesses support and assist each other. BOSB provides an additional dimension to the community, further integrating the 150 business co-managers. BOSB puts on an annual dinner celebrating the student businesses and is also responsible for organizing the Spring Concert booth.  Two members from each business are represented on the Board which meets every week on Wednesday at five.\n\nREQUIREMENTS AND DUTIES\n\t\n1.\tAttendance is crucial at BOSB meetings and each member is required to attend every meeting.  \nIt is also important that the content of the meeting be reported back to the group during All-Staff.  In order for BOSB to function effectively, the information must be filtered down to all the employees of the student businesses. \n\n\n\nBUSINESS COMMITTEE\n\nEach co-manager must have a hand in the Business committee in some way, shape, or form. There are specific \"Business\" roles designated to individual co-managers and passed on like committee roles (but require more wisdom and training from generation to generation). They are as follows:\n\nBookkeeper\n\tBookkeepers keep financial records that track Campus Design and Copy\u2019s expenditures, profit and loss, and cash flow-in sum, the numerous financial activities of the business. The bookkeeper. Usually works in conjunction with the Business\u2019 Consultant for the accounting departments of their companies. Bookkeepers employ database (in our case named the \u201cVendor Ledger\u201d and spreadsheet computer programs (in our case, \u201cQuickBooks\u201d to do their record keeping.)\n\tThere exists one bookkeeper at CD&C, also called the \u201cfull-chargeaweseomelybubbly\u201d bookkeeper. The bookkeeper verifies and enters in the ledgers the details of the Business\u2019 financial transactions. In addition, he or she has the task of summarizing these details in a general ledger. Periodically, the bookkeeper balances the books. When the books are balanced, it is possible to tell ata  glance how much cash has been spent and how much has been received, what the company owes and what is owed to the company, and whether the company has made a profit or suffered a loss. This facilitates monthly reconciliation, and budget analysis presented monthly to the Business by the Consultant. In addition to keeping records, the bookkeeper may issue monthly invoice statements. \n\tBookkeepers perform general accounting duties. They maintain complete sets of financial records, keep track of accounts and verify the accuracy of procedures used for recording financial transactions. They are employed by private businesses, governments, and virtually every other type of institution. As a bookkeeper, you perform a variety of duties. You prepare, control, balance, and check various accounts using standard bookkeeping methods. You enter daily financial transactions in a journal either manually or by computer. You also maintain general ledgers recording the status of various accounts and make sure that all the accounts balance. You also balance the ledgers and prepare financial statements. In order to verify the accuracy of computerized and manual accounting and record-keeping systems you may be asked to perform an audit. In addition you may be expected to prepare statistical, financial, accounting, or auditing reports. There is considerable job mobility in this field since many different types of establishments have need of bookkeeping services. In addition, the need for a focused and accurate bookkeeper at CD&C is key to keeping our business running efficiently and in a sustainable manner. \n\nBulletin Boards\n\tAfter the constant need for someone to keep the boards updated and clean, the bulletin board manager position was assign in the spring of 2008. Responsibilities of this position are to keep an up to date record of who is renting space and how much space was purchased. Keeping the board attractive and neat is an ongoing job also. \n\tWhile keeping students as a target market, the bulletin board manager should also be exploring the various options for advertisers that are off-campus. \n\nCash-Out\nCash-out is an important role in the business. It is necessary for the understanding of how the business is doing financially. \nRequirements/Duties:\n1. Update the Quickbook ledger, Daily Sales Report, and Discrepancy ledgers weekly.\n2. Meet weekly with the CSB consultant to work out any problems regarding the ledger, and anything regarding cash-out. \n3. Report daily deposit amounts to the group as wella s significant cash-out discrepancies when needed at All-Staff. \n4. Ensire that deposits are madder on a daily basis by instructing other employees on the procedure for cash-out, deposit drop-off, and bag pick-up. \n5. Enter deposits, sales tracking, and discrepancies in the CSB\u2019s Excel cash-out spreadsheet. This is due by the 7th of each month, or CD&C will incur a $50.00 fine. \n\nDepartmental Billing\nThe Department Biller is responsible for facilitating payment for work done for departments on campus. (Note: The Departmental Biller cannot concurrently be a member of the flyering committee.) The first most important step in the whole process in Departmental Billing is getting Recharge Authorization Forms filled out. These files allow CD+C\u2019s biller to bill a department at the end of each month. We cannot do anything without these forms, or with them filled out incompletely. First and foremost, we need the department\u2019s name and the date. The speed key, department ID and fund code are also necessary for the procedure. The account # is typically 734300, unless they specify otherwise. This is a code referencing work within the university that is photocopy related. Also we need to know the authorized name, printed and in signiture form, along with their email and a phone number for contact purposes. Also on this form, you will see a section for CD+C\u2019s information (name, sk, ID, etc.) which should be filled out already. \u2018Payment To\u2019 and \u2018Payment From\u2019 distinguish these sections. \n\nUnlike the RSO Billing process, these transactions authorize us to bill up to a certain amount (specified on the Recharge Authorization Form), so they still have a \u2018debit account\u2019. Every transaction goes into the \u201cDepartmental Cash Out\u201d spread sheet on the computer, as well as in the miniwedge, as a \u2018DEPT SALE\u2019. It is important to do these for each and every transaction, even a recharge received (though this isn\u2019t in the miniwedge). \n\nWeekly, the Biller should ideally split the main spreadsheet into the individual tabs that are allocated on another excel file in the \u2018departmental billing\u2019 folder.\n\nMonthly, it is up to the Biller to bring the information into the CSB office. Log into the computers and find the \u2018\u2019Billing Log\u2019\u2019 as well as the actual billing spreadsheet, which Donna sends out to be processed. The log should have rows for each department, along with columns for their information and monthly spending and Recharge balances. It will also total monthly and annually what we receive or a department spends, respectively. For each speed key received one should add a line to the billing log, even if the department repeats their name.\n\nThe main file cannot be altered by anyone but someone who knows what they\u2019re doing. i.e. the Biller shouldn\u2019t edit the file, only should enter information into it. Each column is assigned specific numbers of characters that one cannot exceed or go under without their being an error. For instance, the column for speed key is 6 characters, because the university speed keys are 6 digits. Makes sense. Do not alter any of the formatting or order of columns on this spreadsheet. It may get a little hairy to understand, but it is sometimes helpful to look back at a past-month\u2019s completed sheet for a reference. Some hints: the line that says \u201cCD+C\u201d includes also the department being billed\u2019s information (sk, ID, acct), whereas the complementary line with the department\u2019s name has all of CD+C\u2019s information. Be sure not to save over the blank spreadsheet, each time you start a new one, SAVE AS something different such as \u201cMM YY Billing\u201d\n\nSend the billing log and the monthly billing spreadsheet to Amy.\n\nBetterment of the Biller\u2019s Role: A Former Departmental Biller\u2019s Manifesto\nAlthough the computer system developed in 2006 is much better than the older style which no one reading this will remember, it does have it\u2019s flaws. For instance, the individual department tabs do not account for recharges where it shows a balance. To account for this, I\u2019ve been crediting Recharges as a positive transaction, and the work done, or jobs sold as negative transactions. This keeps the balance accurate. This poses a problem for the Daily Reconciliation however, because when a job is performed and deducted as a negative, and perhaps a Recharge was credited on the same date, the daily transaction totals will not match those on the Sales Report off the Miniwedge. This is because what are entered in the Miniwedge is only the jobs performed. This doesn\u2019t occur for RSO tabs because of how Recharges are entered. \nMany Departments are clueless as to the paperwork behind having copies made and billed to their account. Some know and will have their forms ready when they want to start their account. This is Public Health, Center for Public Policy and Admin and others. It is important we receive the Recharge forms on time because otherwise it will be difficult to get the money we deserve. It is important to educate the departments on the process. I like to emphasize when presenting and introducing a Recharge Authorization Form two important fundamental things. First, the amount they Authorize is simply permission to be billed up to that amount. For instance, Public Health makes their tests with us frequently. I like to get an initial recharge for a large sum, so as to avoid having to get more Forms filled out later in the Fiscal Year. It is important to say this is not deducted from their account, but it simply authorizes us to do the necessary monthly billing. They will see the transaction on a statement of their account. Secondly, the amount transfers from fall to spring semesters, ie. over a fiscal year. This is important because it is beneficial to open a large amount to avoid paperwork for the entire year! I always ask, \u201cIs this a one-time job, or do you foresee coming for more copies this year?\u201d This is a good lead into getting a large balance to start a year off. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to e-mail departments in the summer about this way to have access to our services over the course of the coming academic year. The Athletic Department, for instance has student-athlete receive course packets on their account. They should be notified that if this is the case they should open an account in September to work off of the next two semesters. Ideally, the Biller should have to get Recharge Authorization Forms in September only. That would be nice. \nIn Spring 2008, I was told that it might be the case that the Biller will enter monthly transactions into Quick Books as well. This is a very good idea because the amount in Quick Books, which our CSB Consultant presents montly in reports is seldom what is actually received for the month. This has to do with the discrepancies in the Daily Recon as well as work being done which isn\u2019t entered in the Miniwedge for whatever reasons. The numbers on the consultant\u2019s reports are currently entered into QB by either the Cashout or Bookkeeping Co-Manager, but having the Biller enter this would make the numbers in reports consistent to actual money making. \nIn sum, the role of the Biller is a monthly job which could take less than 2 hours when everything through the month is done correctly, ie. getting Recharge forms filled in completely and promptly. Educating departments and Co-Managers is crucial towards success! The spreadsheets are scary, but easy to get used to and when one is familiar enough it becomes simpler and friendlier\n\nMaintenance\nThe goal of the maintenance co-manager is keep a constant eye on how clean the store is. It is also their job to get rid of toner boxes that pile up, cartridges that must be recycled specially, and figuring out how to get rid of old eqipment that cannot simply be put in the trash. Ideally once every month or so the maintenance co-manager would come into the store on a weekend and do a major clean-up of the store-this includes dusting, washing windows, sweeping, etc. This can be a big job, and they definitely don\u2019t need to do it alone! But it is this co-manager\u2019s responsibility to organize and spearhead a major store clean-up day if one is needed, which includes bringing it up at All-Staff. \nPayroll\nPayroll is an integral part of the Business Committee. The Payroll supervisor must monitor and track all weekly payroll expenditures by Campus Design & Copy. He/she must attempt to keep payroll at an appropriate and consistent level, and communicate this information to the All-Staff. \n\n\nREQUIREMENTS & DUTIES\nThe payroll supervisor must consistently stock the pay sheets. Additionally, a record with all the employees\u2019 names and pay period must be prepared each week, and can be filled out in the payroll binder. \nPayroll must be completed by Friday afternoon. The payroll supervisor must make sure all employees of CD&C have filled out the pay sheet for the week. Those who have not will forfeit their pay until the next pay period. Names, hours worked, and the dates must be recorded. Also the hours must be added up and compared to a breakdown of hours. Make sure all numbers match and if they do not, fix them. If all parts of the payslip are not filled out or not filled out correctly, the employee forfeits their pay until the next pay period. Be sure to check the dates, account numbers, and all other aspects of the pay slips for accuracy. \nWhen hours are incomplete or un-submitted the payroll supervisor is responsible for submitting \u201clate pay\u201d. The week in which the hours were actually worked must be updated in the excel payroll spreadsheet and an adjustment transaction must be entered into Quickbooks for that week. \nIt is the payroll Supervisor\u2019s responsibility to sign-off on the current pay sheet and to have another member from the Business Committee to sign-off on their spot on the pay sheet. Also, an up to date copy of the week\u2019s pay sheet should be kept in the payroll binder. \nRecord all information on the CSB excel payroll spreadsheet. Print two copies, put one in the payroll binder on the bookeeper\u2019s desk and place one copy in the CD&C folder at CSB for the accountant.\n\nPurchaser\nThe person holding this position is responsible for providing Campus Design and Copy with the necessary amounts of supplies in order for the business to run smoothly and without delays.  The supplies include all paper, design, office, and binding supplies. The purchaser must maintain appropriate levels of all supplies and paper; the business should not have too much money invested in inventory. The purchaser for CD&C is also responsible for taking inventory of all the supplies each month. \n\nREQUIREMENTS & DUTIES \n\t\u2022 The purchaser is responsible for the store\u2019s Procard. The Procard is a Mastercard with a $5000.00 monthly/$500.00 daily limit, used for all supply and minor equipment purchases. Every month the purchaser must pick up the pro-card statement from Donna Vanasse\u2019s desk in the CSB. ONLY THE HASER IS AUTHORIZED TO USE THE PROCARD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!\n\n\t\tThe Procard is our primary method of ordering supplies. If the Procard is unavailable or otherwise not usable for a particular vendor, a Purchase Order must be opened with the vendor. \n\t\nCD&C currently has purchase orders (P.O.\u2019s) with these two companies for supplies in case the Procard cannot be used:\n\t\t\t       \nOc\u00e9 - copy supplies, service on the copiers. (Supplies should be ordered in bulk to save money - usually once per semester.)\n\t\n\tWB MN - office supplies\n* Note: When ordering all supplies, be open to new companies with lower prices/bulk order discounts. This involves doing a little checking around for prices. \n\n\tNOTES FOR THE PURCHASER\n\t\u2022 After getting the new list of P.O.\u2019s and account numbers for each business, a list should be made and copies are kept in the purchaser\u2019s desk and on the wall next to the phone.\n\t\u2022 At the beginning of every semester it is very important that we keep an over abundance of paper in the store. At least 10 cases of white paper should be order by the end of the first week of classes. This will ensure that all academic packets can be produced without running out of paper. \n\t\u2022 When ordering from any company, be sure to have the Procard or CD&C\u2019s account number and P.O. number ready.\n\t\u2022 Have a list ready in front of you (the Purchasing LOG) with all of the order numbers, or descriptions, and quantities of what you want to buy. \n\n\tRE-ORDERING PAPER\n\t\u2022 You will know when to re-order paper after you get a feel for what paper is popular and what does not sell.  Always try to sell old stock whenever it is appropriate, for example: in big jobs where the people do not care too much about which color is used. The danger of ordering paper that does not sell well is that it goes bad by drying out, discoloring, and rippling. Here is rough guide of when to reorder paper.\n\nRegular white paper - Always order in large quantities for bulk discount. (Usually when the supply runs down to about 5 cases you can re-order anywhere between 10-12 cases except during rush where a larger store of paper will be needed. \nc\nColored text - This paper is purchased from WB Mason and can be ordered by the box.  Order when less than 4 reams remain, or a large job with a certain color of paper must be done/has just been completed. \n\nColored cover - Same as above (Additional reams of cover paper will be needed during rush for academic packets)\n\nBond paper - This is ordered from WB Mason and can be purchased by the ream or box. It can be popular for large orders due to the fact that it costs less than text overall.  \n\n11x17 paper \u2013 This paper has a low inventory turnover; one ream may last the entire semester. \n\t\t\n\t\u2022 When re-ordering paper, make sure to specify the manufacturer, the name of the paper, the poundage (lb.), the size of the paper, the color, and the quantity (of cases, not reams).\n\n\tINVENTORY\nThe purchaser must take inventory on the last day of each month. Inventory sheets can be found in the Inventory log book on the Purchaser\u2019s desk. Take last month\u2019s computer print-out inventory form and make a photocopy of it. Use this photocopy as a check list for inventory. This way you can see how much paper we went through color by color, type by type glance.\nGo through and fill out the sheets checking all the supplies in CD&C carefully.  This is important in finding out if you are spending too much and keeping us too stocked up. Usually, you can also ignore doing inventory on the small office supplies such as staples, pens, paper clips, etc.\nGo to the Center for Student Businesses and enter the inventory onto CD&C\u2019s file marked \u201cinventory in Excel. Be sure to update changes within inventory (i.e. price changes, new paper used, paper no longer used, etc.).\nAfter the inventory has been entered onto our disk, print out two copies. Give one copy to the CSB consultant and place the second in the inventory log book. This must be done by the 7th of each month or CD&C will incur a $50 fine.\n\nAs of 2008 a new system is in an attempted implementation period in which the inventory is taken and kept track of electronically. This is a good-system-in-the-making because items in the inventory will be kept more relevant as items in the store change, the sheet will be easily edited/adjusted/transferred, and accounting for objects in-store will be easier and more powerfully done with a spreadsheet. \n\nThe hopes for this new system will be that it happens (the recording process) as orders are received or within the same week, so that these benefits are multiplied by their time-relevance. Also, by keeping account of how often we order certain things each month, we can trim the number of orders we make, making the process more efficient.\n\nRSO Billing\n\tIt is the job of the RSO Biller to monitor all the RSOs that have accounts with CD&C. To do this, the billing spreadsheet must be kept up to date, and all RSOs with negative accounts (there should be none!) need to be contacted. The club advisors may be contacted if there is no response. Any organizations with low balances should be emailed with their account information. Be sure to check the internal recharges frequently to make sure they are entered correctly, and that tabs are clearly identified, alphabetized; and more are made when there are few left. Keep in contact with Rosemary and Jeff about our accounts as well. By the 7th of every month, upload an updated RSO billing form on the CSB computers, and go through the internal recharge notebook to make sure all RSO accounts are up to date. \n\nSTEERING COMMITTEE\n4-5 ELECTED MEMBERS  The Steering committee steers the business. This includes the formerly separate committees of Stars and Dots, Hiring and Training, and DVals. Steering meets once a week (usually after all-staff) to go over their own goals and deal with issues of dot disputes, scheduling, and the like. \n\nREQUIREMENTS & DUTIES\nChart a course for the group. This is done by discussing long-term and short-term goals among members and then proposing with the groups.  Such goals may lie within the domain of other Committees (such as getting X number of packets for the next semester), or may pertain to the entire group. \nGuide other committees in their semester goals. This involves being in communication with all committees and being aware of their semester goals and making sure committees follow through with these goals.  Steering should provide avenues for conflict resolution within and between the other committees.  It should also play a role in evaluating each Committee's performance. Therefore, if the members of Steering feel that a particular committee is unorganized and inefficient, they have the responsibility to help in the re-organization and restructuring of the committee in question.  One way to guide committees in reaching their goals is to have steering members visit committees. \nInform the group of upcoming events.  Steering members should be aware of important events and dates (i.e. Facilitation Workshop, next semester\u2019s first All-Staff, University schedules, etc.) throughout the semester and communicate them to the All-Staff.\nBe aware of events and University actions that affect CD&C. This includes anything having to do with space allocation, SGA issues, the CSB, etc...Steering members should either attend the relevant meetings or ensure that another CD&Cer attends and reports back to the group.  Steering must be in constant communication with the CSB and CD&C\u2019s representatives on the Board of Student Businesses.\nGive dots to employees. The Committee must also read through the Discrepancy Book for any occurrences during the week that need to be discussed or may deserve dots. Steering keeps track of each employee\u2019s dots in the Star/Dot notebook. \nDot challenges. Employees can challenge their dots at the Steering committee meeting.  There is a strong recommendation to put a time restriction of two weeks after the dots are given for dot challenges.  If a decision made by the Steering committee is refuted by an employee, the issue will be brought to All-Staff.\nContracts.  Once any employee has received three dots, he/she will be called to Steering committee to be placed on contract.  All-Staff will be notified when an employee is put on contract. \nEnforce the Dot Policy, including contracts, performance evaluations and firing.  (See sections on Dots, Probation and Firing for specifics.) \nStars. The Star system should be analogous to the Dot system.  There should be a Star log that employees can write in when they feel another employee has done a job well or is deserving of recognition.  The Steering committee should take these recommendations and award Stars as it sees fit.\nEmployee of the Week. Ballots should be distributed after weekly stars have been announced so that employees will know who went above and beyond that week and can let that inform their voting.  Ballots will be collected and tallied by Steering and the outcomes announced each week. \nMaking All-Staff aware of employees Star/Dot tally. In a collective environment it is important that every manager has free and easy access to their fellow employees\u2019 (as well as their own) performance records.  Steering should announce Stars and Dots accrued each week on the black board.  A board should be put up in the store so that all the employees will know how they and their co-managers are performing.  \nScheduling Evaluations and Diversity events. Every semester CD&C has a night where each co-manager is evaluated. It is the job of Steering to inform the co-op when that night will be so the co-managers are able to fill out the Evals binder in time for the Evaluation night. Diversity events are a time when the co-managers are able to get out of the store and have fun together. The co-managers can decide what they want to do, but Steering should be the committee to be looking ahead at when that event can take place.\n\nIn the spring of 1997, a Star/Dot Committee was created to take over Steering\u2019s responsibility to dot employees and to enforce the dot policy.  In addition to this it was Star/Dot\u2019s responsibility to establish an incentive program to go along with employee of the week.  However, the committee was soon abolished because it was deemed extraneous.  If at some point, however, if Steering\u2019s responsibilities become too great, the Star/Dot committee may be re-instated. \n\nHIRING \nTo recruit, select, and hire qualified, enthusiastic, and dedicated individuals that suit the needs of CD&C in each hiring cycle. \u00a0To train employees on all aspects of the business and to help them better their manual, teamwork, and customer service skills.\n\n\u201cHiring shapes the future of CD&C.\u201d The importance of this committee can not be underestimated because its members single-handedly determine the direction the business will take in the future. The Hiring Committee is responsible for the hiring of all new CD&C employees at the beginning of each semester. If the committee does a poor job and does not hire qualified individuals, the business will suffer in the long run.  Next to interviewing and selecting applicants, the most important responsibility of the Hiring members is to recruit as many applicants as possible (the more applicants we have, the more choice we have in selecting the best employees).  This recruiting is done primarily through flyering all over campus, posting a listing on UMass\u2019 \u201cJob & Careers\u201d website under \u201cStudent Employment,\u201d and passing out applications to RSO groups. The committee should reflect the make-up of the collective. \n\nREQUIREMENTS & DUTIES \n\tThe hiring process should resemble the following:\t\n1.\tThe committee should evaluate the need for new employees at the end of every semester.   The committee must know who is coming back to work at CD&C, and who will not be returning. From this evaluation, an outline of the ideal employee(s) should be developed (i.e. a need for designers, business oriented persons, sophomores preferred, etc.). A proposal should be presented to All-Staff encompassing the Hiring Committee\u2019s plan, detailing how many and what type of employees to hire.\n2.\tReview last semester\u2019s application and make any applicable changes (the dates on the timeline must be changed) before making a master copy. Set an interview date and reserve a  room for interview dates and times. Make copies of the application packet and display them on the front counter and also outside the CSB. Keep track of how many copies of the application are made.\n3.\tDuring the designated hiring time, in coordination with the Design Committee, flyers should be posted advertising that \u201cCD&C is hiring for ...\u201d stating that applications can be picked up at CD&C.  These colorful flyers should be posted all over campus. This flyering is extremely important to the success of Hiring; if the campus is not blanketed with flyers, the number of applicants won\u2019t be as high. \n4.  A strong effort needs to be made to recruit applicants from diverse backgrounds. This is where the Hiring Committee must work in conjunction with members of the Diversity Committee. This recruiting is done predominantly by advertising our employment openings to specifics groups (i.e. New Africa House, the Native American floor in Chadbourne Hall, AASA, etc.), but any new methods should certainly be attempted.\n5.\tPut all returned applications in one spot and ask other employees to comment on their employability on the back of each application. This gives non-committee members a chance to participate in the hiring of their future co-workers.\n6.\tReview and grade each application, perhaps using an application rating sheet.  The committee should plan to interview approximately 3 times the number of employee being hired. So, if the committee determines that CD&C needs 3 new employees, 9 applicants should be interviewed.\n7.\tAfter deciding who to interview, these applicants should be called and scheduled for interview times at around 20 minute intervals.\n8.   Call references for selected applicants if more information is needed. \n9.\tInterview selected applicants and rate perhaps using an interview rating sheet.\n10.\tMake the decision of who to hire. Make sure to refer back to the description of the \u201cideal employee(s)\u201d for that semester. It is helpful to keep in mind what you will be losing with graduating co-managers, and what you think the business needs in order to sustain itself.\n11. Call all those who were interviewed, and state whether or not they were hired. Remind the new employees of the training session and the first All-Staff.  Select two or three alternates in case those you want to hire change their mind.\n12. Schedule appropriate times to train the new employees while on-shift. These are called star shifts, and will be marked by a star on the new schedule that should be posted for the whole store to see. The new employees will attend their first All-Staff on the following Monday, even if their first star-shift isn\u2019t until later.  \t\n13.  Meet with new employees roughly 4 weeks after they have been hired to discuss the hiring process and their assimilation into the business.  This should hopefully lead to some new insight on how the process can be improved.\n\nRules for Acquaintance Hiring\n\u2022\tYou may read through the application.\n\u2022\tYou may be involved in the interview process.\n\u2022\tYou can give necessary data relating to commitment, another job, or something related to work relations based on factual information.  The information must be pertinent.\n\u2022\tYou may not give purely personal, biased opinions.\n\u2022\tBefore the interview process you may only say that you know the person. Do not give any opinions at this time.\n\n\nD-VALS \t\nThe Evals Committee was formed in the fall of 1995 in an effort to improve the process of Evaluations. Previously, all of the duties were placed under the auspices of the Steering Committee. The Diversity Committee was formed in the fall of 1995 in response to the realization that CD&C had become not only a less diverse workforce, but also in some aspects, an uncomfortable work environment for people of diverse beliefs, backgrounds, and lifestyles. In Spring 2005, these two committees were fused into one to allow coordination in their respective goals and to make Evals relevant during periods when evaluations are not being planned or held. \n\nREQUIREMENTS & DUTIES:\n\tDIVERSITY FOCUS\nAn effort should be made to hire a diverse range of people at CD&C. This does not mean hiring someone because of their skin color, sexual orientation, or physical ability. But it does mean being open to differences and embracing, not rejecting and judging, them. \nEVALS FOCUS\n1.\tPropose prospective dates for Evals no later than 4 weeks into the semester.\n2.\tMake sure every co-manager fills out the Evals binder before the Evals date.\n3. When going over constructive criticism and positive feedback sheets as a group, make sure to use \"I\" statements and to be respectful of the feelings of other co-managers. \n\nCommunications\n\tThe Communications Comanager is part of the Business committee and will work closely with other members of the committee, especially RSO Billing, as most of the incoming information about RSOs comes via email.  At the end of each semester, Communications should compile printouts of all the internal recharges received for the semester and hand this off to RSO Billing for records.  Further, it is the responsibility of the Communications Comanager to manage the email account; including both the GMail and UMail accounts.  Management includes checking the email at least once everyday, as well as fielding questions and price quotes from potential customers.  Similarly, Communications should maintain the website.*  Besides internet related management, Communications is also responsible for making the message on the answering machine, maintenance of messages left, and maintenance of the fax machine.  It is also the responsibility of Communications to email everyone after all-staff to remind them of follow-through.\n\n* Maintenance of the website does not include any coding, just the updating of information.  The website is completely coded, and if an upgrade is needed, someone will be elected to redo the website.  This person should work with Communications to make sure all the correct information is online.\n\n\nPART IV:\nPERSONNEL + POLICIES\n\nCo-Manager Equity Policy\n\tWhen making schedules Steering tries to balance hours by working with the existing school schedules of each co-manager. If there is a problem with too many/too little hours, that co-manager should talk to Steering, and it will be worked out in the easiest way possible. Rush schedule will be different from the actual solid semester schedule, and typically it takes a few weeks to work out the kinks. This is different in practice from the original 1/15 policy, but in spirit it is the same. \n\tIn the beginning of the semester each co-manager is expected to attend the first All-Staff and help with Night Copy. This is a big job due to beginning of the year fliers and academic packets galore, and it is a less scary job if everyone helps out. If there is a problem with a co-manager getting to the first All-Staff the co-managers should be notified a week prior. The store has an email and a phone, and each co-manager has email and a phone as well-there is no excuse for not letting people know in a timely manner that you will be unable to attend. Failure to give proper notification will result in that person having to talk to Steering and possibly being put on contract. Of course, it is always on a case-by-case basis, and emergencies happen.\n\nDOTS, PROBATION AND FIRING\nCD&C\u2019s Dot System is the business\u2019 means of tracking employee problems with lateness, missed meetings and follow-through.  When Steering gives an employee a dot, they are representing the entire collective in this decision. Co-managers are not accountable to the Steering Committee; they are accountable to each other. This is why dots are announced at each All-Staff, so that everyone is aware of any personnel problems occurring in the business. Hence, if and when an employee is put on contract or brought up for firing, the entire group will have been aware of the employee\u2019s situation beforehand. When an employee is late to, or misses, a shift, an All-Staff meeting or a committee meeting, he/she has the responsibility to fill out the Dot Log sheet listed under their name. Company etiquette and honesty dictates that employees write down any such occurrences immediately.  They should be as descriptive as possible when writing reasons for their offense so that the Steering Committee can determine if it should be excused. If the employee does not note their offense, it is the responsibility of others to remind the CD&Cer to fill out the log or do so themselves.\n\nOBTAINING DOTS\nThe Steering Committee has the final say over whether or not an employee will receive a dot(s).  At each Steering meeting, the members look through the \u201cDot Book,\u201d and the \u201cDiscrepancy Book.\u201d  If the members feel that an employee deserves to be \u201cdotted\u201d for something that he/she did, or did not do, during the week, the committee will give the employee the specified number of dots for the offense. By specifying the number of dots per offense (i.e. lateness, skipping shift, etc.), the policy treats each employee fairly. In other words, members of Steering will not receive special treatment since the number of dots for each offense is spelled out. However, the Steering Committee reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of dots when the committee members feel that there are special circumstances involved.  Please note that an employee is given a dot only when the Steering Committee feels that there is no valid excuse for the offense. For example, sleeping past your shift is not a valid excuse; having a death in the family is a valid excuse.  In any event, if an employee is going to miss a shift, he/she must call all co-workers and try to get the shift covered as early as possible.  If an employee obtains a dot and feels that he/she has a valid excuse, he/she may petition the committee to remove the dot. In order to petition, the \u201cdotted\u201d employee must contact a member of the Steering Committee within 1 week of the All-Staff meeting in which the dot was announced and then come before the committee.\n\nOn the next two pages you will find CD&C\u2019s current Dot Policy.  Here each dottable offense is outlined clearly so that each member receives the same consequence.  This policy is reviewed and revised every semester by Steering so that it always pertains to the way that CD&C operates.  \nCampus Design and Copy Dot Policy\nThis policy's purpose is to ensure that each co-manager fulfills his/her objectives and responsibilities while remaining focused on the cooperative ideals of our beloved CD&C. The giving of a dot for any infraction listed below is necessary in order to improve our competence as a business.  Steering will be available and plans to cooperatively assist all co-managers who choose to contest any dot. Discretion is allowed if a co-manager feels that a dot is deserved for an infraction not listed below.  This list will be amended as necessary throughout the semester.\n\n\n1. Late over 10 minutes without a call \t\t\t\t\t\t1 dot \n2. Late over 10 minutes with a call\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00bd dot \n3. No show for shift without a call\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2 dots \n4. No show for shift with a call\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 dot\n5. Incomplete or no order form\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 dot\n6. Mishandling Jobs (i.e.: user error resulting in sub-par job)\t\t\t1-2 dots\n7. Leaving a mess in the store \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00bd dot\n8. Lack of Committee follow-through\t\t\t         \t1 dot to member at fault\n9. Messing up cash out\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00bd dot\n10.

Personal Printing without recording on employee tab\t\t\t\t\u00bd dot\n\t\nPROBATION\n\tOnce an employee obtains 5 dots, he/she will be called before the next Steering meeting (usually held Friday afternoons). When an employee is \u201ccalled before Steering,\u201d it is announced at All-Staff and a written notice is placed in the employee\u2019s mailbox stating the date and time of the meeting.  At the meeting between the CD&Cer and Steering, the employee will have an opportunity to address the reasons for their dots. At this time, the Steering Committee can decide whether or not to put the employee on probation. If the employee is not put on probation, he/she will be given a warning. If the problem persists, the employee will be called before Steering again and put on probation and a contract will be drawn up. If the committee decides that the employee should be placed on probation, he/she will be notified immediately. This probationary period lasts 3 weeks. The employee promises to address their behavior in this period and attempt to improve.\n\nPerformance Review\n\tIf an employee obtains 5 dots in a single semester, they are brought before the co-op for review. Steering will review the dots accrued by the co-manager in question, and the co-manager will have a chance to explain the reasons for their dots. The group will then discuss the co-manager\u2019s performance while they step outside of the meeting. Their offenses should be carefully weighed against the co-manager\u2019s assets to the business. A vote will be held to fire the employee after all discussion. A simple majority in favor of termination is all that is required to terminate the employee. Should the employee\u2019s job be spared, they go back to 3 dots, the \u201cwarning\u201d margin for performance. \n\n\tIf and when an employee is fired, the Steering Committee is responsible for deciding whether or not a replacement should be hired.  If the committee determines that it is not necessary, then the terminated employee\u2019s shifts are covered by the rest of the group (This also applies if an employee quits mid-semester).\n\nTHE DOT  CHART: \nHOW THE SYSTEM WORKS\n\nEach co-manager starts every semester with a clean slate\nCo-manager obtains 5 dots\nCo-manager meets with Steering Committee\nCo-manager is put \u201con contract,\u201d steering excuses the dots OR decides not to put employee \u201con contract\u201d this time\nCo-manager fulfills contract by not obtaining more than 2 additional dots OR co-manager breaks contract and accrues 2 additional dots. They are then brought up for firing\nAt the next All Staff, Steering proposes that the employee is fired.\nCo-manager  is fired or CD&C decides not to fire the co-manager by vote at All Staff. Co-manager is brought back to 3 dots.\nStart back at 1. If you get back to 2, just fire the co-manger already.\n\nPost firing policy\nIn the event a Co-manager is brought up for firing under the dot policy but is not fired, the following procedure should be followed:\nThe co-manager in question is still considered to be under contract, but of a more serious nature.\nThey go back to 3 dots, the \u201cwarning\u201d margin for performance. Any further dots accrued mandate an immediate meeting between the co-manager in question and the steering committee.\nAt this meeting, steering will determine if the is significant enough to initiate a new firing procedure for this co-manager at the next possible All-Staff.\nThe purpose of this step is for steering to filter out possible reasons for the new dot which result in a repeat of the previous firing procedure.\nFurthermore, if the co-manager in question does not show up to the designated meeting with steering, they will automatically be brought up for firing at the next All-Staff.\n\nEVALUATIONS\nEvaluations, commonly referred to as \u201cEvals,\u201d are an event held after all-staff mid-way through each semester. Evals are a chance for every CD&Cer to evaluate themselves, their co-workers, and even the collective as a whole. Evals are an extremely important part of the group\u2019s development and all employees are required to attend.  Often times, many new ideas come from Evals and the group becomes re-energized for the second half of the semester. Evals is purposely held half-way through the semester so that employees may see their weak spots and have a chance to improve on them before the end of the term. This time should be seen as a chance to give feedback to co-workers in addition to (not instead of) the day to day feedback that is sweetly given.  That is, if a CD&Cer has a problem with a co-worker, he/she should not keep their gripes bottled-up until Evals; the employees should work out their personal differences beforehand.  Many first semester employees do not know what to expect, nor do they understand the significance and seriousness of Evals until that very day. Therefore, such employees should review this section of the handbook before filling out the Evals binder. The following is a description of the Evals process:\n\nSteering proposes a date for the event within the few weeks of the start of each semester. This is so that everyone may clear their calendars and not have any conflicts on the selected date. \nBefore this date it is each co-manager's responsibility to go to the Evals binder and fill out information for their own self-evaluation and for each co-manager that they have direct contact with on a regular basis. Each co-manager has one self evaluation page with an attached page for positive comments and one page for constructive criticism, separated by tabs. There is also a page to comment on the collective as a whole. Please fill this binder out in a quiet place where you can reflect honestly about what you write. \nAt the designated Evals day after All-Staff each co-manager gets handed their positive and constructive comment sheets. Co-managers have the option to directly respond to their received comments. This is also the time where co-managers raise their hands to say things directly to this co-manager. \nCo-manager discuss the comments about the collective as a whole, pat each other on the back about the good onse and come up with ideas to deal with problems.\n\nGUIDELINES FOR USEFUL FEEDBACK\nPlease keep the following guidelines in mind as you fill out your written evals and when you give verbal feedback to co-workers throughout the semester.\n\n1. Describe behavior that you observe, rather than stating interpretations or conclusions you draw from the other\u2019s behavior. E.g. \u201cWhen I come to talk to you about customer complaints, you sigh loudly and roll your eyes,\u201d rather than, \u201cYou have a bad attitude towards the customers.\u201d\n2. Be specific rather than general. To be told that \u201cYou are sexist,\u201d is probably not as useful as to be told \u201cAt All-Staff you frequently interrupt me and other women in the room and you reject proposals from me and other women until a man speaks in favor of them.\u201d\n3. Take into account the needs of the receiver of your feedback. It could be destructive if it serves only your own needs, (e.g. to vent frustration). Let the other person keep their self-esteem as intact as possible.\n4. Don\u2019t overwhelm the other person with data.  The receiver of your feedback needs time to absorb it. The longer you go on, the less the other person will hear, and the more defensive he/she will become.\n5. Check your timing. In general, feedback is most useful at the earliest opportunity after a particular event or behavior, (depending, of course, on the other person\u2019s readiness to hear it and support from others).\n6. Check to ensure clear communication. Ask the receiver for her understanding of your feedback.\n7. Use the formula for constructive criticism:\nWhen you _________, I feel ________, because ________ .\n(Carolee Cloture, Community Consulting Group, 1987)\n\n\nPERSONNEL/BUSINESS POLICIES\nEMPLOYMENT POLICY\nCampus Design and Copy is an Equal Opportunity Employer. The business aims to have its employees represent the diverse backgrounds and lifestyles that exist in the Umass community. All full-time Umass undergraduates are eligible for employment.\nRETURN POLICY\nCD&C employees are required to attend the first All Staff of each semester or make contact with the group prior to it. Failure to do so will is grounds for firing for any employee not meeting this requirement.  See Co-manager Equity Policy for early semester requirements.\nQUITTING POLICY\nIn the event that a co-manager decides that he/she wants to quit the business, he/she is obligated to submit a formal memo informing the collective of his/her impending departure and present it at All-Staff. It is then required that the co-manager retain their duties and responsibilities to the collective for at least two weeks following the official declaration of departure. This policy is applicable primarily to those co-managers wishing to quit after the hiring period but before the very end of the semester. \n\nPlease note, this is not a substitute for a co-manager fulfilling his/her two semester commitment to the collective; it should not be viewed as a \u201cloophole\u201d to offer an easy out of a commitment to CD&C that was explicitly outlined and agreed upon by the co-manager prior to employment.\n\nRE-HIRING FORMER EMPLOYEES\t\nAt times, employees leave the business only to return after a semester or two.  This is most common when students study abroad or take time off from the University.  Those employees who left the business in good standing (\u201cgood standing\u201d = not on probation, not being fired) and have been gone from CD&C for only one semester are automatically re-hired.  Those employees who are gone from CD&C for more than one semester must file an application, but they are automatically interviewed during the regular hiring period (i.e. first 3 weeks of the semester).  In the process of re-hiring former employees, members of the Hiring Committee should feel free to consult with co-workers who have worked with the employee in question to get further information.  It is the Hiring Committee\u2019s responsibility to re-acquaint re-hired employees with the business (i.e. new policies, new employees, etc.).  Whenever possible, those employees who are leaving the business should indicate whether or not they intend to return.  \nEMPLOYEES AND MONEY AT CD&C\nEmployees have liberty over everything they do at CD&C, yet with this liberty come a great deal of responsibility.  This is especially true when it comes to employees and money.  We must all rely on the honor system when dealing with the finances of the business - cashing out the register, filling out pay slips, making purchases, etc.\nDiscounts:  Co-managers receive discounts on copies; they may purchase copies at cost.   Co-managers may use the company\u2019s computers free of charge, but this privilege should not be abused (i.e. letting friends use the computers, excessive use, doing outside jobs, etc.).  However, CD&C work is the priority.\nEmployee credit:  There is no employee credit; co-managers cannot borrow money from the business.\nEmployee pay rates:  As of January 2008 the state-wide minimum wage was set to $8.00/hour. Pay raises will not be disregarded all together; the current solution has the sole purpose of  allowing enough time so that CD&C can proficiently, and effectively adapt to this weighty change in finances.  \nHow to get paid:  CD&C employees are paid bi-monthly through the University with money from the business\u2019 account.  In order to get paid, each employee must fill out their hours for the week on a timesheet. This slip must be filled out completely by Friday at a time selected at the Payroll person\u2019s discretion. The total hours cannot exceed 40 hours per week and no more than 8 hours per day. It is the responsibility of each employee (and not the Payroll person) to fill out the slip properly and on time, or else he/she won\u2019t get paid until the next pay period. Not filling out a weekly slip throws off the financial books and makes it inconvenient for the payroll person as well as Donna, who processes payroll for the student business. \n\nNEW EMPLOYEES POLICY (THREE WEEK GRACE PERIOD)\nNew employees often feel a little lost or confused in their first two months at CD&C. This is ok! And it gets better, we promise. Not only do they have to learn how to run the copiers, the cash register, the computers, the fax machine, etc., but they must also learn how the business is run.  Very few new employees are familiar with the idea of collective management, and it is often difficult for them to find their niche in the business.  In an effort to facilitate this transition into CD&C, the \u201cNew Employees Policy\u201d was created in the fall of 1995.  It dictates that all new employees must visit one Steering Committee meeting and one meeting of another committee of their choosing (a committee of which they are not a member) within a month of being hired.  The new employees are paid for the length of each meeting.  Furthermore in the fall of 2006, the co-managers at CD&C decided upon a \u201cThree Week Grace Period\u201d as an illustration of a co-op trial period.  This trial phase includes two weeks consisting of star shifts, during which new hires observe and learn as much possible of the business from existing co-managers.  The third week is dedicated to the personal improvement of each new hires.  Members of the Steering Committee also use this last week to meet with each new hire to get a sense of their acclimatization to the store.  The three week grace period also allows any new hire to leave the business if he/she fells any signs of discomfort (whether in the particulars, commitment of a co-op, or the overall milieu of the business).  \u201cIf existing co-managers feel that a new hire is not right for the store then it needs to be brought up first with steering, and steering will bring it to all staff formally.  At all staff the store will be informed of the events and feelings in this matter and the termination of the new-hire will be out to a vote\u201d (Hiring and Training Proposal, fall 2006).      \n\nTraining\nEveryone will be training new co-managers in order to make sure that each person in the store is fully knowledgeable of the responsibilities pertaining to their respective jobs.  When a problem or question arises, they should assist the employee in obtaining a proper re-training. Employees must be aware of their responsibilities so that they know what is expected of them.  CD&C employees must be trained efficiently and thoroughly in all aspects of daily procedure including the following: opening, closing, night copy, night design, policy and other various procedures. \n\n\nTo provide a full-scale training to new employees immediately after they have been hired. This training should include all store procedures, with particular focus on the cash register, computers, pricing policy and the copiers. There is a checklist that should be given to the new-co-managers and gone over. Once they and you feel that they have been trained well and \u201cknow the drill\u201d, the box should be checked off. At the end of the training period (3 weeks, or at the discretion of the co-op) the new co-managers should be taken through a mock customer/co-manager interaction. This roleplaying would consist of a member of H&T pretending to be a customer. The goal is to ask them to do things that they have been trained on (ie, please make chops, please make a transparencies, please laminate this double-sided document). This is to see how well the co-managers have been trained thus far, and to prove to them that they know what to do! In addition to store procedures, employee should also be shown the Center for Student Business, Student Activities, etc.  Steering committee members should also go through the handbook with new employees and answer any questions that arise.  \nTo be able to answer any questions about store procedure or policy.\nTo provide trainings to other employees when necessary (not just new ones!).\n\n\nStore  Policies\nExpedited Orders\nIf the order is taken before \nNo expediting fee applies except for very large orders or design jobs. This is up to the co-manager taking the order to use their discretion to see how busy the shop is, how many orders have been taken, etc.\nIf the order is taken after \nNormal size orders can be completed by store opening the next day. If you want a large order complete the same day it can be expedited for a 15% fee. This only applies to orders that can physically be done in the span of time left before we close. So please do not come into the store at  and expect to have a large order expedited and complete before we close at 5. \nWriting a check?\nGet a student ID or a state-issued driver's license or general state ID, and write the number on the top of the check. Stamp the back with the smaller CD&C stamp (the one without our logo on it), and initial the front. \nMake sure the check is made out to Campus Design and Copy, and that they include the total price (order price+tax) on the check, not just the order price. \nCredit Cards\nAny order under $5.00 that is paid for with a credit card requires a $.50 charge before tax.\nRefund Policy\nALL SALES ARE FINAL, and\u2026\nAll large orders must be sign off on with a proof. This judgment call concerning size is at the discretion of the co-manager taking the order-if you aren't sure, ask! After a proof is signed, refunds will only be offered on jobs when the finished product does not match the signed proof. \nIf an error is discovered by CD&C before the customer leaves the store and if the error is deemed by the co-managers to be the fault of CD&C, the work will be redone. \nIf an error is discovered after the customer leaves the store and if said error is found by CD&C at AllStaff to be the fault of CD&C, then we will discuss as a collective and determine an appropriate course of action. CD&C is under no obligation to the customer at this point, as CD&C is indemnified of responsibility of any and all errors in work once the customer leaves the store.\nFURTHERMORE\nAll portions of the work containing errors are returned prior to the work being redone. Only those portions of work containing errors will be redone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart V:\nBUSINESS AND FINANCE\n\nIf We Are Not-For-Profit, \nWhy Do We  To Make A Profit?\nCD&C is a \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d organization.  Unlike most other business, we are not in business to make a profit.  Yet, we must still budget (meaning set prices and wages) to make a profit.  The primary reasons for this are outlined below.\nTO COVER THE COSTS OF OPENING.  Each semester when CD&C opens, we must open up purchase orders with all of our vendors.  In order to do this, we get loans from Student Activities which must be repaid at the end of the fiscal year; there must be enough money in our account to cover these costs.\nTO COVER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. Machinery breakdowns or other emergencies can cause unexpected losses during a semester.  For this reason there must be enough money to cover opening costs and any unexpected financial losses.\nTO REINVEST IN THE BUSINESS.  Ours is a business which is constantly growing and changing with technology.  All money made beyond what is needed to cover costs and plan for unexpected losses should be reinvested into the business.  Specifically, this money is used to buy new capital purchases, upgrading old equipment, buying new equipment, and updating the store. \n\nCD&C Vendors\n\nThe  of a hase Order\nPurchase Orders (more commonly known as P.O.s) are how CD&C makes all of its purchases.  Everything from pens to paper to copier toner is paid for through the Student Activities Office via P.O.s.  Just like Ross must open up 's to do business with CD&C, we must open 's with our vendors.  The process for opening a P.O. is outlined below.\n\nDECISION TO PURCH - CD&C employees decide to make a purchase. The purchase must be budgeted for and a proposal must be passed. \nOPEN A PURCHASE ORDER - The bookkeeper fills out a purchase order worksheet and has it signed off by one of the coordinators at CSB.\nTHE P.O. GOES TO STUDENT VITIES - The P.O. worksheet is delivered to the Student Activities Office for their review.  It is then typed and signed by the office manager Allen Brainard.  \nCOPIES OF THE P.O. DISPERSED - A running copy of the P.O. is kept on file at Student Activities.  CD&C receives the original and a vendor copy which must be mailed or delivered to the specific vendor (i.e. Unisource, etc.).  \nCD&C MAKES PURCHASES - Once the vendor receives its copy, CD&C can make its purchase.  The money is deducted from the Purchase Order by Justine at Campus Activities and is also tracked by the CD&C bookkeeper.\nINCREASE THE P.O. - As purchases are still being made during the semester, the P.O. will run low.  Eventually an increase must be made by the CD&C bookkeeper.  The same procedure is used for a P.O. increase.\n\nTHE  OF A CAPITAL PURCHASE\nCapital purchases are large purchases (this refers mainly to the purchase of a new copier). Everything from pens to paper to copier toner is paid for through the Student Activities Office. Because capital purchases have a substantially higher cost than operating inventory the purchase must be approved by Student Activities. To process of obtaining approval is outlined below:\nDECISION TO PURCH - CD&C employees decide to make a purchase.\nPROFIT ANALYSIS - A spreadsheet must be created detailing the revenue that CD&C expects to earn from the purchase or the amount that CD&C expects to save by switching vendors.\nADVERTISING INITIATIVE - An advertising plan must be developed and outlined with any related expenses that will be incurred at implementation.\nPROPOSAL - A proposal must be organized with the profit analysis, advertising initiative, and documentation of any additional costs related to the purchase (maintenance, set-up, logistical, technical requirements, training, etc.) \nPRESENTATION - The proposal must be presented at All-Staff and passed by all members. If they proposal is approved it is brought to the  and Student Activities for approval. \n\nTHE LIFE OF A BILL\n1.  THE OR IS DELIVERED TO CD&C - Most of our orders are delivered to the CD&C office, but some may be delivered to the Student Activities Office, which then notifies us. \n2.  VENDOR GIVES CD&Cer THE GOODS AND AN IICE - The employee on shift should check the contents of the package, ensuring that the receipt and contents match up.  He/she must then sign for the order.  Our copy of the receipt should be given to the Purchaser, who must verify the order and file the receipt.\n3.  CD&C REVES IICE - The vendor sends an invoice, or bill, to CD&C via Student Activities. \n4.  BOOKEEPER ENTERS INVOICE INTO THE WEEKLY GENE LEDGER - The bookkeeper gives the invoice to Sue in SAO and gives a copy to the CSB consultant and files it in their notebook.\n\nFINANCIAL TERMS MADE EASY\nBUDGET:  CD&C\u2019s budget, which is prepared by the CSB consultant, is a projection of activity expected to occur during a particular semester.  It is a breakdown of monthly sales and expenses, and is necessary as a guideline for us to recognize our expectations and limitations.\nNET SALES:  The total sales is the total cash, credit card, Ucard, monthly RSO charges, monthly academic billing, and sales tax received deposited into our account.\n OF GOODS SOLD:  This is the amount that we pay for the goods that we have sold for a particular period of time. It is calculated by taking the dollar amount of inventory at the beginning of the month, adding the purchase amounts of goods for resale and then subtracting the dollar value of the end of month inventory.  Inventory is taken by the Purchaser.  \nGROSS MARGIN:  The gross margin is the amount of money we have left over to pay our expenses after we deduct the cost of goods sold.  The gross margins should be between 35% and 40%.\nTOTAL EXPENSES:  Total expenses comprise the total amount of money spent on services and items such as copyright clearance expense, leases, maintenance expense, phone & fax charges, etc. needed to run the store, as well as other miscellaneous expenditures.\nNET INCOME:  Net income is calculated by subtracting total expenses from the gross margin. This may be a positive (gain) or a negative (loss) number and represents the amount of money left after all expenses have been deducted.  Negative figures are placed in parentheses, positive figures are left normal.\n COSTING:  This tax is 8.3% of purchases, payroll, and expenses.  This amount goes to the Student Activities Office in return for their services. Other taxes and dues are:\nCSB TAX - 1% of net sales given for services\nBOB DUES - $50 per semester in support of the Board of Student Businesses\nNASCO DUES - $35 per semester to belong to NASCO\nSALES TAX - Quarterly sales tax paid to commonwealth for taxable services\n\n\n\nGoooooo CD&C!"}]}, {"Name": "Cannabis Education Coalition", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "2021 UMass_CEC_Constitution.pdf", "Data": "Constitution of the Cannabis Education Coalition\n\nName & Purpose: The name of this Registered Student Organization (RSO) is\n\nI.\nthe University of Massachusetts at Amherst Cannabis Education Coalition, hereafter\nreferred to as the \u201cCEC.\u201d CEC is a pro-choice organization founded in 1991 and is the\noldest student-run organization devoted to ending the prohibition and stigmatization of\ncannabis both locally and nationally and advocating for its industrial, medicinal, and\nrecreational use for moral, environmental, and economic reasons.

Statement of Beliefs Concerning Cannabis:\n\nthis purpose, which quorum consists of 20 members.\n\nbrought before a\n\na.\n\nIndustrial Cannabis Products:  UMACEC believes that the benefits to the\nenvironment and to the consumer of the widespread utilization of industrial\ncannabis products, such as paper, textile, oil, and animal feed, far outweigh the\nbenefits that the prohibition of cannabis brings to certain elements of big business,\ntherefore UMACEC believe that industrial cannabis products should be allowed\nto freely enter the market.\n\nb. Cannabis Medicines:  UMACEC believe that certain cannabis medicines have\nbeen proven very effective in treating certain ailments, such as glaucoma, and\nnausea from cancer chemotherapy, and AIDS, and have also shown to have very\nfew side effects, and therefore, UMACEC believe it is cruel to deny patients\naccess to potentially life-saving cannabis medicines.\n\nc. Recreational Cannabis:  UMACEC supports the removal of all criminal and civil\npenalties for the possession and consumption of cannabis.  UMACEC believes\nthat this is a civil rights issue.\n\nd. Regulation: UMACEC advocates a system of cannabis regulation that would\n\ninclude age restrictions, public health and agricultural controls, and taxation of\ncannabis for profit.  A well planned system of cannabis regulation would\ndiscourage abuse, protect public health and safety, reduce crime associated with\nillicit distribution, and raise large sums of new tax revenues.  Regulation is the\ninevitable replacement of prohibition.\n\ne. Personal cultivation:  UMACEC believes the right to possess cannabis also\n\n\fincludes the right to grow substantial amounts for personal use, transport, and to\nmake casual, non-profit gifts of small amounts of cannabis.\n\nf. Drug abuse:  UMACEC believes that drug addiction is an illness which is best\ntreated by doctors rather than by prison guards.  UMACEC is opposed to drug\nabuse, whether illegal or illegal drugs are involved.\n\ng. Destruction of Criminal Records:  UMACEC urges the enactment of legislation to\nprovide for the destruction of criminal records of persons arrested for or convicted\nof cannabis offenses prior to the enactment of legislation repealing criminal\npenalties for such offenses.\n\nh. Public Use: UMACEC recognizes the individual rights of non-smokers not to be\nsubjected to discomfort, or whatever health risks may arise from the smoking of\nany substance in designated non-smoking areas, however UMACEC is opposed to\ncriminal law being used to regulate such activity.\n\ni. Driving While Intoxicated:  UMACEC strongly discourages driving motor\n\nvehicles while under the influence of any drug, and recognizes the legitimate\npublic interest in the prohibition of such activity.\n\nj. Role of the Military in Law Enforcement:  UMACEC opposes any use of the\n\nmilitary in civilian, domestic law enforcement.\n\nk. Cannabis Eradication:  UMACEC is opposed to the use of Paraquat and all other\nchemical or biological agents intended to destroy or identify cannabis under\ncultivation in this or any other country.  UMACEC supports the prohibition of\nherbicides, fungicides or any other chemicals used to spray cannabis as consistent\nwith the protection of public health and the environment.\n\nl. Cannabis Research and Women:  UMACEC urges revisions of current FDA\n\npolicies which severely limit cannabis research on women of child-bearing age.\nUMACEC believes that such restrictions are unwarranted, and that studies on the\neffects of cannabis on women and men of all ages are necessary, important, and\nshould be encouraged by the NIDA and other similar agencies.\n\nBY-Laws of the Cannabis Education Coalition\n\nI.

But, to move money between categories (such as from Travel to Equipment) will require a special \nrequest  to the Recreation Club Council for approval.\n\nChess Club\n\nCategory\n\nEquipment & Maintenance\nEquipment & Maintenance\nEquipment & Maintenance\nOther\n\nRecreation Club Name\nClub Funding Priorities\nPriority\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nItem(s)\n\nChess Clocks\nChess Pieces\nChess Boards\nFlyers\n\nRCC Approved Allocation - Allocation Committee Use Only\n\nMany of these items are one-time purchases, which SGA will\nfund.

Each chapter is to hold a minimum of seven meetings during the school year, four of \nwhich must be educational. Reports of ALL meetings must be sent to the National \nHeadquarters within 15 days following the meeting. \n\n3. Each student chapter must include a minimum of one club tour each year. This may be \nconsidered one of the four educational meetings and minutes should be sent to the \nNational Headquarters. \n\n4. Within three years of being granted a chapter charter, the university/college must have a \n\nclub management course as part of its curriculum. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f5. The chapter President must submit an annual report to CMAA\u2019s Chief Executive Officer \n\nby May 1 of each year or 15 days after the last chapter meeting, whichever is first. \nFurther explanation and forms are available online at \nwww.cmaa.org/studentchapterofficers.aspx\n\n. \n6. At the end of each school year, each chapter is reviewed by the Chapter/Member Services \n\nCommittee to determine if chapter requirements have been met. Failure to meet the \ncriteria may result in the chapter\u2019s loss of its charter. \n\nUMass Requirements \n\n1. Have at least 10 undergraduate students at all times \n2. Ensure all RSO trainings are completed  \n3. Submit a budget each year to the SGA \n4. Attend all SGA required meetings \n5.

The student group has agreed that it will carry out the mission and present the messages of Cru.\n\nARTICLE II\u2014PURPOSE\nThe purpose of the Chapter, as articulated in the Charter, is to build movements of people who are transformed by Jesus Christ. \u00a0The student-led movement seeks to introduce students to Jesus Christ, help them to grow in their faith, encourage them to live life passionately under the lordship of Christ, and inspire commitment to advancing the purposes of God in the world.\n\nARTICLE III\u2014STATEMENT OF FAITH\nThe Statement of Faith is the doctrinal foundation of this organization.\nThe Statement of Faith for this organization can be found at http://www.cru.org/about-us/statement-of-faith/index.htm.\n\nARTICLE IV-STATEMENT OF MISSION AND VALUES\nOur mission is to be a spiritual family that helps students grow in their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and encourages others to explore and investigate the person of Jesus Christ. \u00a0In short, \u201cwe want to be a spiritual family that knows Christ and makes Christ known.\u201d\n\nWe also want to encourage all students to attend various local churches that agree with the statement of faith in Article III.\n\nWe want to help others consider the person and deity of Jesus because we believe that there is no question in life more important than the \u201cGod question,\u201d and college should be a time to wrestle with the biggest questions of life. \u00a0We always want to do this in a manner that is both respectful and intelligent. \n\nARTICLE V\u2014MEMBERSHIP\nSection 1.\nMembership will consist of at least 10 students and shall be open to all duly enrolled University of Massachusetts-Amherst students. Membership and activities are open to all currently enrolled students.\nVoting membership shall consist of those members who regularly attend large group meetings, or a member of a small group Bible study for the previous six months, and have attended a Cru retreat or conference.\nThis Chapter may have associated members who are students from local colleges or non-students, such as faculty and staff, community members, alumni and Cru staff members. Associated members shall have all membership privileges except the right to vote or hold office.\n\nSection 2.\nA member may lose the privileges of membership, including the right to attend meetings and events sponsored by Cru, under the following circumstances:\n1. \u00a0If the individual is causing disruption to the group or is engaged in disorderly conduct or threats.\n2. \u00a0If the individual poses a danger to other students.\n3. If the individual\u2019s conduct rises to the level of harassment of another member of the group.\nUnder such circumstances, two or more members of the leadership team will meet with the individual, share the concerns, and ask him or her to leave the group. \u00a0The accused member may then request a hearing before the full leadership team. \u00a0The President, or another officer, will then call a special leadership meeting. They will hear from the accused member as well as other witnesses, confer, and make a decision regarding the accused member\u2019s membership rights. \n\nSection 3: All members have the right to express their opinions and speak freely on any matter regarding the organization and can address the leadership team as well as the members of Cru.\n\nARTICLE VI \u2013 OFFICERS AND LEADERSHIP\nSection 1: Officers\nThe officers of this organization will serve as liaisons with the University. \u00a0The officers of this organization shall be the following:\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0President\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vice President\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secretary (Communication Director)\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Treasurer\nTerm of office: An officer shall serve for one year from the start of his term or until his/her successor is selected.\nLeadership team: The leadership team shall consist of the officers and additional selected leaders, who also meet the qualifications spelled out in section 2, that will provide direction for various aspects of the Chapter\u2019s purpose.\n\nSection 2: Qualifications\nIn order to be eligible for office, members must demonstrate that they are qualified to serve as representatives of the Chapter and the organization of Cru. \nA. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attendance requirement: Officers must have been involved for at least one full semester, having attended 75% of weekly large group and/or small group meetings (unless they were not in residence because they participated in an off campus study abroad program, an internship, or were involved in a Cru Chapter on a different campus).\nB. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Knowledge requirement: Officers must complete the Chapter\u2019s leadership application which shall determine the applicant\u2019s experience and skill in providing spiritual leadership for the Chapter, knowledge of the Chapter\u2019s core messages, and understanding of how to model the Chapter\u2019s messages in their behavior.\nC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alignment requirement: Officers must commit to lead the Chapter in a way which is consistent with the mission and faithful to the messages of Cru. Officers should follow Jesus\u2019 example of leadership in word and deed. This will involve: \n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guiding the Cru Chapter to serve the University community by seeking to care for student\u2019s emotional, physical and spiritual needs.\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leading ministry teams, teaching the Bible and using Cru materials in a manner that helps believers to grow in their Christian faith. This involves leading small group Bible studies, helping facilitate Christ-centered weekly meetings, or training members how they can communicate the messages that are central to the Chapter\u2019s identity and mission.\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Demonstrating by example how to live in a manner that is consistent with the Biblical teachings Cru communicates. \u00a0In order to communicate the Chapter\u2019s message clearly and with integrity, officers must not only speak the Chapter\u2019s messages, but also live in a manner consistent with those messages. This requirement recognizes that communication is a multifaceted reality, requiring alignment between the words and behavior of the communicator. Failure to live consistently with the messages communicated results in hypocrisy and lack of credibility. \n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presenting the Gospel of Jesus Christ in a manner designed to lead other students to examine, consider and accept the Christian faith as their own. Willingness and ability to clearly and respectfully present the Gospel of Jesus with an opportunity for people respond personally.\nD. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Additional Eligibility Requirements: Officers must meet the school\u2019s eligibility requirements for leaders of registered student organizations as required by the Student Government Association.\n\nSection 3: Selection Process\nA. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Officers of this Chapter will be chosen either through election by voting membership or nomination by the previous year\u2019s leadership team which then is confirmed through election by the voting membership. \u00a0See Article VI. Additional leaders will be selected from the general membership. They will be chosen based on their ability to meet the same qualifications as the officers, and their willingness to serve.\nB. \tApplicants who meet the qualifications outlined above shall be eligible for a leadership position.\nC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applicants may be asked about their willingness to model the Chapter\u2019s core messages through their behavior so that the messages are communicated with integrity.\nD. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The staff members of Cru serve an advisory role in the selection process, working with the current leadership team to consider and evaluate potential new leaders. The leadership team will then select individuals, inviting them to take the new leadership roles.\n\nSection 4: Removal of a Leader\nLeaders may be removed from their positions by a majority of the Leadership Team. \u00a0Any member of the Chapter may make a complaint against any leader in the Chapter, including a member of the Leadership Team. \u00a0Following the complaint, the Leadership Team (or members of the Leadership Team) shall meet to confer with the Chapter\u2019s Cru staff for advice and counsel. They will also meet with both the complaining individual and the accused leader. No leader may be removed without first receiving a full and fair hearing from the Leadership Team. A leader complained against may only be removed by at least a simple majority agreement of the remaining members of the Leadership team. \nAny misrepresentation on the leadership application or a change in the leader\u2019s commitment to lead the Chapter to fulfill its purpose as stated in Art. II, shall be grounds for the immediate review of the leader\u2019s position by the Leadership Team.\n\nARTICLE VII--ELECTIONS\nSection 1.\nTypes of Elections: Elections will occur at the end of each term to select the following term\u2019s officers. \u00a0Special elections may be held when an office is vacated in mid-term.\n\nSection 2.\nNomination of Candidates: Candidates for an upcoming election can be nominated through the voting members or by the leadership team. \u00a0Any member may raise a question or concern to the leadership team regarding a present or proposed leader. \u00a0The candidate must meet the qualifications for office listed in Article VI, Section 2, in order to be placed on the ballot (or selected for any leadership position in a given term). \n\nSection 3.\nForm of Vote: Voting members shall vote under this article by secret ballot.\n\nARTICLE VIII\u2014MEETINGS\nSection 1.\nTypes of meetings:\nA. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Membership Meetings: Formal meetings of the voting membership to conduct a vote.\nB. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Large and Small Group Meetings: Regularly scheduled meetings for all members to attend.\nC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Additional Meetings: Gatherings, in addition to regularly scheduled meetings, which are open to all members.\n\nSection 2.\nQuorum for Membership meetings: In order to conduct a vote of the voting members, at least half of the voting membership must be present at the meeting. \n\nSection 3.\nMeetings shall be held to further the purposes of the Chapter. \u00a0The leadership team, in consultation with Cru staff, shall determine the frequency, time and place, and agenda of the various meetings.\nLarge group meetings typically occur weekly during the school year, breaking when instruction ends and during school vacation periods. \u00a0Small group meetings (Bible Studies, Discussion Groups) also meet weekly within the same parameters. \u00a0Other meetings necessary to advance the purposes of the Chapter will be held as occasion warrants.\n\nARTICLE IX\u2014FINANCES\nThe Chapter may raise revenues through contributions, fundraising activities or by applying for school funds available to student groups. \u00a0Paying dues is not a mandatory requirement to be considered a member of this organization. \u00a0Students, however, may be asked to contribute for such events as special social gatherings, retreats and conferences in order to attend. \nThe Chapter will hold to high standards of financial integrity. \u00a0A member or several members of the leadership team will be responsible to carefully administer any school funds granted to the Chapter.\nARTICLE X\u2014ADVISORS\nThe officers will work with the Campus for Student Development advisor as assigned.\n\nARTICLE XI\u2014CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\nSection 1.\nThe leadership team may seek to amend this constitution by general consensus.\n\nSection 2.\nArticles II and III may not be amended without express written permission of Cru.\n\nSection 3.\nAll amendments, additions or deletions must be filed as is required with the office of Student Government Association at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.\n\nCreated: 3/25/2015\nAmended: 5/14/15\n"}, {"Name": "Final Allocation FY16", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Initial Allocation_Cru_FY16_Budget_Request Initial Allocation.xlsx", "Data": ""}]}, {"Name": "Cycling and Sustainability Club", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}]}, {"Name": "Dance Company", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "UMass Dance Company Guide (constitution_bylaws).pdf", "Data": "UMass Dance Company Guide\n\nAccount Info \u2013 Department ID: A714646000\nAccount Info \u2013 Fee Account Speedkey: 148303\nAccount Info \u2013 Revenue Account Speedkey: 148304\n\nDeposits\n\" You are required to deposit both cash and checks into your RSO's account the\nnext business day. If you collect cash/check on the weekend the office will be\nopen on Monday.\n\" You should give a written receipt to anyone from whom you accept cash, and\nkeep a record of all receipts. Receipt books are available for free from the Center\nfor Student Development Office. Checks should be made out to the University of\nMassachusetts Dance Company.\n\" To deposit checks go to room 416 of the Student Union (if you were coming\nup from the campus center, you go up to the staircase left, take a right at the end\nof the hall, and left at the end of the other hallway). You will deposit the money\ninto your revenue account (the speedkey is listed above; however, if you look\nforget it they can look it up for you, or you can look it up on the computers there).\nThey will give you a deposit slip. Bring the deposit slips the Cashier's Office at the\nbottom floor of the Campus Center. The Campus Center Cashier's Office will not\ncount your deposit immediately (maybe within 2 days) so make sure you keep the\nreceipt.

You want to book them as late\nin the semester as possible, as to give choreographers and dancers enough\ntime to prepare. For the fall showcase, the latest weekend you can book the\nshowcase is generally the weekend before Thanksgiving. For the spring\nshowcase, the latest weekend you can book the showcase is generally the\nweekend before finals (this gives approximately two to three extra weeks of\npreparation for the spring showcase). The university will not book any events\nduring the reading period or final examination period which excludes\n\n\fapproximately the last two weeks that students are in school to book the\nshowcase.\n\n-\n\nFill out the event request form located on Campus Pulse. This can be located\n\nunder UMass Dance Company -> Events -> Create Event. You can copy and\npaste the description for the past showcase events instead of typing a new one\n(UMass Dance Company -> Events -> Past Events). Make sure you mention\nthe amount of guests, the supplies we will need, and the acapella group\nperformance. You can fill in three dates and times when you fill out the event\nrequest form. Your first choice should go through, because you went ahead\nand talked to Melinda beforehand, but still make sure you fill in two other\npossible dates and times, because things can always go wrong.\n\n\" After about two weeks past the mid-semester date, you should receive a\nconfirmation regarding the showcase. If you have not, contact Melinda.\u201d\n\n\" You will then be receiving an AFS form in the gmail account. You must\nthoroughly read this over and make sure everything is requested correctly.\nThere are always errors. Do this immediately, because the showcase\u2019s\ntimeslot can be taken over by other groups until all of the details are\nSolidified.\u201d\n\n\" After the AFS is confirmed, you will receive an Event Order Form, which you\nmust repeat the same process for.\u201d\n\n\" You then must go in to see an ECO in the SORC. You will confirm everything\nyou requested with them. You will also go over the layout of the room.\u201d\n\nIn the CCA, we put the stage on the first wall perpendicular to the actual\nstage. You will put a long curtain in the back, with two wings on each side.\nThe 300 chairs will be facing the stage with an isle in the middle. The\nacapella group will be on the stage with just enough chairs for them\nfacing the stage. There will be two spotlights in the back of the room\nshining onto the stage. The two treelights will be right in front of the stage\non each corner facing inwards. There will be one or two tables right when\nyou walk in on the left for the donations box, programs, snacks, drinks,\nand whatever else you want to put out.\n\nWhat you Need to Request\n\" 300 chairs \u2013 free\n\" 2 wireless microphones - $30\n\" 1 set of treelights (this is 2 treelights) - $50\n\n\f\" 2 Spotlights (this is all the University owns) \u2013 free\nCoat racks\n\" Room 168c at least 1-2 hours before the showcase for a cappella rehearsal\n\" 3 tables ( 1 table for donation box and UMDC poster, 1 table for baked goods)\n\" AV speaker to play music \u2013 free\n\" Request room from 10am to 5pm (for set up, rehearsal, and clean up)\nNo catered food\nNo security needed\nNo tickets\n\nWhat you Need to Provide\n\nCurtains- UPC form needs to be filled out at least a month before the show\n\nPrograms \u2013 Make sure you have these made at least a week before the showcase,\nbecause there are always problems trying to print them, so you are better off\nhaving it done earlier.\n\no The best option for printing is the copy and print center in the student\nunion. This is the cheapest option, and they can print the programs on all\ndifferent colors of paper. They have weird hours though, so you want to\nlook into that.\n\n\" Two table clothes for the tables with the food and programs, etc.\n\" A donations box.\n\" Pastries and food (these always go rapidly, so make as many as you can!)\n\" At least four signs pointing people in the right direction (one for either entrance\nof the CCA, one pointing down the escalator, and one pointing into the CCA)\n\" Gifts for the seniors, if you chose to do so.\n\" Bagels for the dancers and helpers.\n\" An ipod to play the music on \u2013 THIS IS CRUCIAL.\no Make different playlists for each song, so they don\u2019t automatically play, or\nseparate each song by a lag of 10 seconds or so, so they don\u2019t play straight\nafter, and the sound people have time to pause it.\n\nPeople the day of the showcase\n-hosts (preferably 2 people) - or entire UMDC\n-someone to play the music\n-acapella group\n-videographer\n\nCampus Pulse description:\n\u201cThe UMass Dance Company will perform a number of originally\n\n\fchoreographed dances. The UMass Dance Company will also be joined by an on\ncampus acapella group. The show will last between 1.5 and 2 hours, with a 10\nminute intermission. The dancers will work during the semester choreographing,\nrehearsing, and perfecting their pieces in order to produce a professional level\ndance showcase performance.\u201d\n\nPhoto shoot\nGroup shoot once new members are picked\n\nEveryone wears black\nMeet at the back of the FAC stairs\n\nIndividual shoot\n\nCan wear anything\nPick a weekend and give time slots for people to sign up for\n\nPost new photos on Facebook and Campus pulse pages\n\nActivities Expo\nAttend both fall and spring expos if possible\nNeed to register online at campus pulse when re-registering RSO for a new academic year\nUMDC poster\n100-200 mini flyers with audition info\nLaptop for people to write down email and personal info\n\nAuditions\n.\nYou need to have the date for auditions figured out before the Activities Expo,\nbecause you need to tell people when it is!\nYou should have auditions before all of the other dance teams! A lot of people\ndon\u2019t know the difference, and you don\u2019t want to lose anyone to Stage Crew or\nDance Team just because they had their auditions first. Find out when they are\nand make sure you have yours before.\nAll of the members should be wearing UMDC apparel so everyone auditioning\nknows who is on the team.\n\n\" We have found that the best time to have auditions is between 7:30-9:30. Some\nclasses get out at 7:15, so you don\u2019t want to exclude these people from\nauditioning. 7:30 still isn\u2019t too late though, so it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask people\nto come at this time.\n\n\fWhat you need:\nStickers for everyone to wear a number.\no An information sheets:\nHalf sheets for everyone to fill out full name, dance experience, year in school\no Everyone should have notebooks to make notes about those auditioning.\nFormat:\no In the past we have had across the floor turns, leaps, and tricks.\no Jazz/contemporary combo (make sure this is representative of the type of\ndancing that we do)\no It generally takes about 2 hours \u2013 you should try not to go over this\nbecause people may have homework already\n\" How to judge:\no In the past we have each held notebooks. We have sections for each part\nof the audition (i.e. across the floor, combo, etc)\no Write people\u2019s numbers that you want underneath each section\no At the end each person should have a list of everyone\u2019s numbers that they\nwant on the team, but it\u2019s also helpful to have it divided into sections,\nbecause even if a member doesn\u2019t vote for a person to be on the team\ninitially, if another person brings up their number you can look back and\nsee if you\u2019ve marked them for something.\n\nChoosing new members:\nDiscuss new members at the end of the audition\nMake a finalized list and email people the next day\n\nRole of the Board\n\" The role of the board is only to facilitate what needs to be done. It is a democratic\nteam in which everything that can be voted on must be voted on. The board\nshould be able to identify what needs to be done and provide several options\nabout how things can be accomplished. They then present the options to the\nteam for a vote.\n\" Currently there are 5 board members. If this needs to be changed there must be a\nvote on it.\no Odd numbers tend to work the best, because it allows for tie breakers.\n\" Board members should be there all year! It has not worked out in the past having\nto vote in new board members every semester. Reasons for this:\no Only the people that were there in the fall will have any authority on\ncampus pulse.\no You will need help from the board members abroad to get things\naccomplished, because technically they are still board members on campus\npulse.\n\n\fo The new board members will not have access to Campus Pulse, and thus,\ncannot fulfill many of the responsibilities of being a board member. This\nputs more pressure on the other board members.\no There is no time for the new board members to shadow, because they can\u2019t\nshadow people who are in their first semester of being a board member;\nthis is not helpful.\n\" Every board member is a co-director. Everyone has the same role in the eyes of\nthe team.\no On campus pulse someone must be registered as the President and\nsomeone must be registered as the Treasurer; however, this does not mean\nthat they should be seen differently or have more power than the other\nboard members.\no Everyone, in fact, must have a role on campus pulse, but other than\nPresident and Treasurer, it doesn\u2019t matter what the other titles are.\n\" Signature Responsibility:\no Two of the board members must have signature responsibility.\no To hold SR you must fill out forms online and in the SORC at the end of\nthe year or beginning of the new year.\no Without 2 of the members holding SR you will be unable to book any\nevents.\no SR lasts for the entire year, so it is even more crucial that these two board\nmembers are present for the entire year.\n\" Training:\no There is a day in the fall that all RSO board members must go to training.\nIf you miss this day, you cannot be a board member. It lasts all day and\nfood is provided.\no Make sure you attend the budget and bank workshops that are offered on\nthis day, as they will give you a lot of guidance.\no There is online training that all board members must complete as well. It\nis in the form of an OWL type quiz.\no The person registered as treasurer on campus pulse must do additional\ntraining on OWL \u2013 so consideration should be given to who is going to be\ntreasurer. (The treasurer may also need to be present when dealing with\nthe bank account depending on how strict the employees of the bank and\nthe transfer station are.)\n\nTimeline\n\" End of August - The first thing you need to do when you get to school is contact\nRoger, the space coordinator at the Rec Center.

There will be a meeting wherein the candidates will state briefly their qualifications and\nreasons for wanting to run to the general body. An anonymous, electronic vote will be held (on\nStrawPoll, Google Forms, etc.) Two thirds of the members will be required to be present for the\nspeeches. These will take place sometime in March. Specific dates will be suggested by Officers,\nand a Google Form will be sent out to determine a specific March date. All elections will be held\nduring regularly scheduled general body meetings.

The process of the election will be similar to that of a regularly scheduled election, in\nthe sense that every candidate would have the chance to state their qualifications and reason for\ninterest. If a member of the general body or the executive board has received complaints about\nbehavior deemed serious and harmful by the board that threatens the organization\u2019s philosophy\nand goals, a special meeting will be conducted to determine that member\u2019s future in the\norganization. They will have a chance to discuss the issues privately with the executive board,\nand then the general body. An electronic vote will be held in person or over Zoom without the\nmember in question present. The Secretary (assuming they are not the member in question) will\ncollect and organize the results of the vote. If two-thirds of the general body votes to remove the\nmember or officer, the member or officer will no longer be welcome to attend meetings and\nactivities held by the organization. This member or officer will be notified verbally by all other\nOfficers, and will be sent an email by the President (if they are not the officer in question: if they\nare, the Vice President will do this) informing them that they are no longer welcome to attend\nmeetings and activities held by the organization. If they are an officer, they are required to\nrelinquish their duties and any access they have to Executive Board information.  \n\nStatement of Free Speech: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommunication will be open and encouraged, but if there is an issue of disrespectful\nbehavior, a meeting with an officer may be scheduled.

Faculty Advisors shall \nnot be entitled to vote, to hold office, to penalize, or to veto, and shall not be liable for actions \ntaken by the Chapter. \n\nARTICLE V \u2013 ELECTION OF CHAPTER OFFICERS \n\nThe executive officers of this organization, ordered by line of succession, are as follows:  \n\n1.  President* \n2.  Vice President \n3.  Director of Operations \n4.  Director of Finance \n5.  Director of Communications \n6.  Director of Management Information Systems \n7.  Director of Actuarial Science Career Development \n8.  Director of Risk Management & Insurance Career Development  \n9.  Director of Industry Affairs \n10. Director of Alumni Affairs \n11.

Candidates are restricted to running for one officer position at a time and are \nrequired to write a brief summary of their qualifications at least TWO DAYS in advance to be \nincluded in the ballot. They will also have an opportunity to represent themselves before the \nChapter during the election meeting. \n\nAll members are required to vote in the poll, which will open at the end of the meeting, and a \nmajority of votes in each category shall constitute a victory. In the event of a tie, the current \nofficers who are not involved in the contested position shall interview the candidates and select \nthe most qualified individual. \n\nElected officers will assume their positions for the following SCHOOL YEAR and may serve for \na maximum of TWO YEARS in the same position. Should an officer position become vacant \nduring the middle of a term, there shall be a new election by the membership to fill that vacancy \nwithin TWO WEEKS. If the vacancy is the presidency, the line of succession shall determine the \ntemporary successor. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fARTICLE VI \u2013 OFFICER TRANSITIONS \n\nAll new and current officers are required to participate in a transition consisting of the following \nthree components:  \n\n1.  Shadowing and Training \n2.  Attending an Officer Retreat \n3.  Consultation Availability \n\n1. Shadowing and Training \nOnce new officers are elected in April, current officers are required to thoroughly train their \nsuccessors for the remaining weeks of the semester.

Whenever possible, alumni are encouraged to help run the retreat. \n\n3. Consultation Availability \nAll former officers are required to be reasonably available to answer their successors\u2019 questions \nand to give advice when requested. This could range from a few text messages to an email or a \nquick phone conversation. \n\nProviding officers with this resource helps aid them with the anxiety of stepping into a new role \nby having that ongoing support available. It also helps them deal with novel problems or \nanything not covered in their training. That is, something that might take a new officer an hour to \nfigure out alone could be explained in a few minutes. \n\nARTICLE VII \u2013 RECALL OF OFFICERS \n\nOfficers are subject to recall for failing to meet the obligations of their positions. Officers may \nonly be removed on the basis of a reasonable complaint addressed respectfully at a Chapter \nmeeting. A panel consisting of at least two Chapter officers and the Faculty Advisor shall \ndetermine the reasonableness of the complaint. \n\nBefore removal, there must first be an attempt to remedy the situation, and no vote to remove an \nofficer may occur sooner than TWO WEEKS after the initial complaint. There must be a \nmajority vote of the Chapter membership in favor of removal in order for an officer to be \nstripped of his or her title. Removal from an officer position is permanent, but the former officer \nmay remain a member of GIS. Following an officer\u2019s removal, the position shall be treated as a \nvacancy and will follow the procedure mentioned previously in Article V. \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n\fMember Rights and Obligations \n\nARTICLE VIII \u2013 NON-DISCRIMINATION AND MEMBER EXCEPTIONS POLICY \n\nThis organization shall not discriminate on the basis of age, color, ethnicity, gender, national \norigin, disability, handicap, race, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status. \n\nThis policy includes\u2014but is not limited to\u2014the following areas: recruiting, membership, \nactivities, and opportunities to hold office. \n\nARTICLE IX \u2013 AMENDMENTS \n\nAll proposed amendments by Chapter members must be presented at the second meeting of each \nsemester. Potential amendments should be specific and include a statement indicating the need \nfor that particular amendment. A majority vote at the following meeting is required to pass an \namendment, and the Director of Operations is responsible for submitting the revised Constitution \nto the Secretary of the Registry for approval. The President has the authority to call for a mid-\nsemester vote on a critical amendment. \n\nARTICLE X \u2013 DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n\nAny club-related dispute between members may be respectfully brought to the attention of the \nVice President. The Vice President shall then present the issue to the President, who will decide \nwhether the issue can be handled at the next club meeting or whether an emergency officer \nmeeting needs to be called. The disputing members must all be present in order for the situation \nto be discussed or resolved. If the issue is with the President or Vice President, members may \nbring it to the attention of a Faculty Advisor, who will then determine the urgency and handle the \nsituation with the same responsibility that would otherwise be left to the President. \n\n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n\fStatements \n\nARTICLE XI \u2013 STATEMENT OF FREE SPEECH \n\nAll participants of this organization may and are encouraged to address the Chapter during \nmeetings.

If anyone \nhas any concerns or fears whatsoever about hazing, he or she should contact the Chapter \nPresident. The Beta Chi Chapter holds a zero-tolerance policy toward hazing. \n\nARTICLE XIII \u2013 NOT-FOR-PROFIT STATEMENT \n\nThis is a not-for-profit organization. \n\nARTICLE XIV \u2013 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH CAMPUS REGULATIONS \n\nThis organization shall comply with all University and campus policies and regulations and \nlocal, state, and federal laws. \n\nARTICLE XV \u2013 STATEMENT OF JUSTIFICATION AND FUTURE GOALS \n\nPlease refer to our Startup Manual (2015) for a comprehensive justification and outline of future \ngoals. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n\f"}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}]}, {"Name": "Gardenshare", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "FY16 Initial Budget Allocation Gardenshare.pdf", "Data": "How to Use This Form\n\nRecreation Club Allocation Committee - Budget Request Form\n\nReview your entire budget breakdown and select those expenses that you would like paid for by the Univeristy of Massachusetts Amherst through an allocation of SGA funds from the Recreation Club Council Allocations Commmittee.

However, relatively few international flights fly into Bradley. You may connect to Bradley through Boston Logan International Airport or New York John F. Kennedy Airport.\nThe best way to reach UMass from Bradley airport is by hiring a shuttle:\nValley Transporter: 800-872-8752\nThis is most likely the cheapest option, but they were closed during the pandemic. Check out their Facebook page for when their services will resume.  \nSeemo Shuttle: 413-586-1120\nBluebird Transportation: 413-221-4512\nMichael\u2019s Limousine & Transportation Service: 800-533-8470\nIf you\u2019d like to use any of these services, one of the current UMass students can help you make a reservation (they need a credit card number to make a reservation). \nThere is no direct bus or train service between Bradley airport and UMass. \n\nFrom Logan Airport (Boston): (95 miles/160 km from Umass Amherst)\nLogan Airport in Boston is the nearest major international airport from UMass. It is about ~2 hrs from Amherst by car.\nThe best way to reach UMass from Logan is through the \u2018Peter Pan\u2019 (https://peterpanbus.com/) bus service. It costs about $35-40 for a one-way bus ticket. \nAt the Logan Airport, you will have to take public transportation the Silver Line (SL1) to Boston South Station. This can take up to 30 minutes, but it is free. You can also Uber to the South Station from the airport for approximately $14. \nPlease note that Peter Pan\u2019s schedule has been impacted by the pandemic. Currently, there is only one bus coming from Boston South Station to UMass Amherst, which leaves at 4:15pm daily. Please check company website for updates and changes.\nShuttle Service: Most of the shuttle services listed above provide transport from Boston Logan to UMass. \nUMass Rideshare: This is a Facebook group run by UMass students for UMass students. You may be able to find a ride with a student from Boston to Amherst in as low as $20 or as high as $160. Please read and respect the rules of the group.\n\nFrom JFK Airport (New York): (145 miles/240 km from UMass Amherst)\nLocated in Queens, NY, JFK is ~3.5 hrs from Amherst by car.\nRefer to the following website on how to reach UMass from JFK: https://www.cics.umass.edu/grads/arriving-amherst\nTransportation within the Five-College area\nMost buses operated by PVTA are free year-round for students. \nExceptions include B43 and R29 which charge a fare. A valid UMass student ID is an acceptable fare payment during the months that the university is in session. Meaning just show your student ID and you are good to go. However, during summer and winter reduced service periods, 5 college students are required to pay a fare (around $1.5 per ride). \nUber and Lyft are also available in the area. \n\nAccommodation\nMost graduate students live in off-campus housing where they pay a monthly rent. Amherst is a relatively expensive place to stay, with a high demand for housing. Rents typically range from $700-$1100 a month (for a single person). For a family, the rents may range from $1200 - $1600. \nThe best place to start looking for housing is on the UMass off campus housing website (https://offcampushousing.umass.edu/). It has a nice layout that is easy to understand. If you find a place that you like, one of us will be happy to check it out and give advice. Some tips as you search for places to rent:\nFor your first year, look for housing that is in Amherst, Belchertown and Sunderland. They all lie on the bus route. Pelham is also an option, but you need a car because it is not on the bus route. While many students live in surrounding towns of Northampton, it can be a little isolating to live there during your first year. \nCraigslist- while this is a useful option for finding good rental places, avoid it during your first year. Once you arrive and have a better idea of your options, you can make use of Craigslist to find places to rent.\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst (UMASS) Housing, Sublets & Roommates: This is an off-campus housing Facebook group that connects\nBuy Nothing Amherst MA: As the name suggests, this is a Facebook group that offers free items to receive, borrow, lend or share. \nContact person - We will try our best to accommodate people for one or two nights while you move into your new place when you arrive. You can contact   Sadaf Latafat (slatafat@umass.edu) if you need help finding a place to stay the day you arrive in Amherst. We will do our best to help but no guarantees as spaces do tend to fill up fast.\n\nPrayer Spaces \nHampshire Mosque (451 Russell Street, Hadley): This is the closest mosque from UMass. It can be reached by bus (route 33, B43) in about 10 minutes. There are daily prayer services here along with Friday prayers at 1 pm all year round. Also, a great way to connect with the Muslim families and community in the area.\nUMass Muslim Student Association (MSA). The Prayer Room is located in the Student Union Building, Room 355. Many students use this space for daily prayers and to meet other Muslims. This room is open for all graduate and undergraduate students, faculty and staff, and guests. Lavation rooms are also available for making wudu/ablutions nearby: Room 352 for the sisters, and Room 354 for the brothers.\nIslamic Society Western Massachusetts (ISWM): This is the biggest mosque in the area located in West Springfield (~35 minutes from Amherst by car).

We hope to engage students not enrolled in the College of HFA and include the whole campus in our promotion of the Humanities and Fine Arts.\nWe believe that all undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst deserve a voice and the ability to be heard. We believe that a student organization is the best way to prioritize student voices. \n\nProcess for Establishing Voting Membership\nTo obtain voting membership, one must be an undergraduate student at UMass Amherst, but not necessarily in the College of Humanities & Fine Arts.\nUMass faculty, graduate students, alumni, and members of the Five College community are welcome to attend our meetings but cannot vote or hold an official position.

The Special Events Committee will use their meeting time to plan the next week\u2019s meeting.\nAt the beginning of each semester, the Executive Board will meet with the Advisor to determine a general schedule for the semester\u2019s meetings. At the end of each semester, the Executive Board will meet with the Advisor to reflect on the general success of the semester and begin planning for the upcoming semester.

Decision Making During Meetings. The Chapter will follow Robert\u2019s Rules of\nOrder to make decisions. The elements of Robert\u2019s Rules are as follows:\n\ni. Motion: To introduce a new piece of business or propose a decision or\n\naction, a motion must be made by a group member (\"I move that......\") A\nsecond motion must then also be made (raise your hand and say, \"I second\nit.\") After limited discussion the group then votes on the motion. A\nmajority vote is required for the motion to pass\nPostpone Indefinitely: This tactic is used to kill a motion. When passed,\nthe motion cannot be reintroduced at that meeting. It may be brought up\nagain at a later date. This is made as a motion (\"I move to postpone\nindefinitely...\"). A second is required. A majority vote is required to\npostpone the motion under consideration.\nAmend: This is the process used to change a motion under consideration.\nPerhaps you like the idea proposed but not exactly as offered. Raise your\nhand and make the following motion: \"I move to amend the motion on the\n\nii.\n\niii.\n\n4\n\n\ffloor.\" This also requires a second. After the motion to amend is seconded,\na majority vote is needed to decide whether the amendment is accepted.\nThen a vote is taken on the amended motion. In some organizations, a\n\"friendly amendment\" is made. If the person who made the original\nmotion agrees with the suggested changes, the amended motion may be\nvoted on without a separate vote to approve the amendment.\nCommit: This is used to place a motion in committee. It requires a second.\nA majority vote must rule to carry it. At the next meeting the committee is\nrequired to prepare a report on the motion committed. If an appropriate\ncommittee exists, the motion goes to that committee. If not, a new\ncommittee is established.\nQuestion: To end a debate immediately, the question is called (say \"I call\nthe question\") and needs a second. A vote is held immediately (no further\ndiscussion is allowed). A two-thirds vote is required for passage. If it is\npassed, the motion on the floor is voted on immediately.\nTable: To table a discussion is to lay aside the business at hand in such a\nmanner that it will be considered later in the meeting or at another time (\"I\nmake a motion to table this discussion until the next meeting. In the\nmeantime, we will get more information so we can better discuss the\nissue.\") A second is needed and a majority vote required to table the item\nbeing discussed.\nAdjourn: A motion is made to end the meeting. A second motion is\nrequired. A majority vote is then required for the meeting to be adjourned\n(ended).\n\niv.\n\nv.\n\nvi.\n\nvii.\n\nMeetings of the State/State-Area Conference\n\na. Our Chapter shall attend the Annual Meeting hosted by the NAACP New England\nState Conference who shall also head the meetings.

Constitution for UMass Rang\n \nArticle I: Name of the Organization.\nThe recognized and official name of this organization shall be UMass Rang.\n\nArticle II: Mission Statement.\n\tUMass Rang will do its best to provide a space for students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to be able to learn about and perfect music with one another, while performing at musical and multicultural events for others\u2019 enjoyment.\n\nArticle III: Group Description.\nUMass Rang is UMass\u2019 first co-ed Hindi-English fusion a cappella group. Founded in October 2013 by Sakshi Regmi and Shirin Hakim, Rang prides itself on its cultural diversity and South Asian ties. We strive to educate others about Desi culture and showcase the ability to not only sing a cappella styles of music, but also do so in a refreshingly new, multilingual way. In order to develop a sense of community, this club shall be open to anyone, regardless of prior Hindi language knowledge. Group outings will be made to strengthen group friendships in order to work well with one another during rehearsals and perform exceptional concerts.\nWe are a different group solely because of the fact that we are a cultural a cappella group. We sing not only western-styles of music, but also add Hindi and other Indian songs into the mix. The Hindi-english fusion style is a new sensation throughout the country, and we believe that it has to do with the ability to expose the audience to a very beautiful style of music. We greatly believe in our ties with our culture, and strive to produce setlists that showcase styles of music that people of all backgrounds can enjoy and connect with.\nThe members of UMass Rang will strive to educate themselves musically through rehearsals and performances, with special emphasis on the pronunciation and exposure of the Hindi language. We will also work towards educating general audiences about Hindi-english fusion a cappella. \n\nArticle IV: Membership.\nSection I: Auditions.\nUMass Rang is open to anyone who is an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Graduate students at the University\u2014as well as members of the five-college consortium\u2014are also welcome in the group.\nThe Audition process and requirements are as follows:\nInitial Auditions.\nThe audition process begins with a general audition in which all interested students can attend.  General Auditions are held for two days during times designated by UMass Rang, and may be extended at the discretion of the Executive Board. \nAll members of UMass Rang will evaluate each candidate based on a song chosen by the candidate and performed by the candidate. \nThe candidate will then be asked to sing sets of scales to determine pitch accuracy, a vital entity needed for an understanding of a cappella music.\nThe group will determine who will be called back to a second audition through a vote. \nA two-thirds majority in that vote is needed to call back a candidate for a second audition.\nCallbacks.\nThe candidates will learn part of a song that the group uses in performance, which will be demonstrated for them by the group. \nThe candidates will perform the piece with the group, and then individually to determine blend with one another. \nThe group members will then decide, based on musical ability and blend, which candidate or candidates fit the current needs of the group in a vote.\n A two-thirds majority is needed in that vote to admit new performing members into the group.\nThere is only one round of callbacks\u2014only certain exceptions will be made in the case of emergencies. \nOnce accepted to UMass Rang, members no longer need to audition for a spot in the group. Members who intend to take a semester off will be allowed reinstatement upon their return provided they notify the group both of their intent to leave before the onset of the semester in which they will be absent, as well as their intent to rejoin upon return upon return to the University at the onset of the semester in which they will be absent. \nSection II: Attendance.\nAll members are expected to attend all rehearsals and reserve enough time to actively perform with the group. \nAttendance will be taken at every rehearsal, which is to be recorded and kept up-to-date by the Secretary.\nMembers must keep in contact with the members of the Executive board if they know that they will be missing a rehearsal.

We receive financial support from UMass, which accounts for a portion of our budget. The balance of our budget comes from Club dues and team sponsored fundraisers.\nThe school provides use of fields for practice and games which are located off of Stadium Road, next McGuirk Stadium. These fields are under the jurisdiction of the Athletic Department and cannot be used without the express permission of Mr. Dan Markowski, the Associate Athletic Director.\nThe school, club, and club officials DO NOT assume responsibility for any injuries which may occur, and they DO NOT provide additional insurance to any participant. All club members must provide proof of insurance to participate. In addition, we request you provide us with an emergency contact, and advise your parents/guardian that you have joined the club.\n\nWhat the Team Provides:\n\n\tRugby is a physical, contact sport which requires a certain level of athleticism and fitness. The team has organized practices Monday through Friday in the afternoons and/or evenings during the season and specified times during preseason. The purpose of these practices is to teach players game skills, condition players for rugby and to learn the team game plan. Games are traditionally held on Saturdays, but may vary according to our schedule.\n\tThe team provides game jerseys for the players and will have rudimentary medical supplies available such as tape, water, and ice for games. If a player has specific needs to participate, such as braces or orthopedic appliances it is her responsibility to obtain those and confirm that they meet all rule requirements. In addition, players are expected to purchase a pair of game shorts and team socks which are required on the playing field. \n\tThe team is managed through elected officers. The officers are: President- Corinne Herlihy , Vice President- Loan Vuong, Treasurer- Gabby Moriello, Match Secretary- Molly Farber, Social Secretary- Christine McHugh, Fundraising Coordinator- Lindsey Stanton, and Public Relations- Shannon Kelly who run the administration of the club. The captains Shelby Vance (forwards) and Kayla Hourihan (backs) and are in charge during game situations.\n\tThe officers hire the coaches who oversee practice, game plans, and selections. The current coaches for fall 2014 are Amy Cheesman (978) 870-6725 and Emily Stone (978) 886-2769.\n\tA large part of being on a rugby team is the social aspect. You will make friendships that will last well beyond your college years. The team holds a number of social events during the year such as team banquets and we frequently will host a visiting team after the game for a social. Both UMass and US Rugby prohibit the consumption of alcoholic beverages at any college venue and we ask that the players respect this rule.\n\nTeam Affiliations:\n\n\tWe currently play in Division I in the New Enlgand Rugby Union (NERFU) which is known as our Local Area Union (LAU). NERFU is part of the Northeast Rugby Union (NRU), which is one of the seven territories which compromise the US Rugby Union (USARFU). Part of the dues paid to the club by the players goes to these organizations. Each player must be enrolled in CIPP with USARFU in order to play in an A-side game. This also provides additional insurance coverage to a player.\n\tThe UMass Women\u2019s Team has had a great success in league play in the last 12 years which also winning 4 NERFU Championships in six of the last twelve years. During the past twelve years we have placed numerous player on all star teams, including eight on the National Under 23 Team and we have produced fourteen All Americans.\n\nWhat is Expected of the Players:\n\nThere is a club participation fee of $60.00 per season. Players need to pay this or make arrangements with the Treasurer (Gabby) prior to the first game. \nPlayers must commit to attending practices and being available for all games\nWe understand that academics should be everyone\u2019s highest priority and players are excused from practice for school related activities such as classes, labs, and qualification exams\nSome players need to hold jobs while in school and may miss practice for this reason. We ask players try to arrange their schedules so as not to conflict with practice and that the payers give a copy of their schedule to the team each season. \nIf a player cannot attend at least 3 of the 5 practice in a week she must speak to the Captains and Coach to determine if she is eligible to play (for returning players).\nIf a player must miss a practice she is not excused from she must contact the Captains and/or Coach and inform them. \nPlayers must inform the Coaches if they have any conflicts during the season whereby they may miss a game 2 weeks prior to game so arrangements can be made. \nPlayers are expected to participate in all pre-season workouts which includes the week prior to classes in the Fall Semester and indoors in the evening during February and March in the Spring Semester. \nThe team will also have arrangements for Spring Break in order to prepare for the season. Attendance is mandatory.\nSelection for the A-side are based on Ability, Attitude, and Attendance. The Coaches and Captains choose the players for A and B side. If the player is unhappy about her selection she should speak to the Coaches and Captains.\nPlayers are expected to remain at the fields supporting the team until all games are concluded. We encourage players to invite friends and family to the games, but please make sure they are aware of your commitment. Also, please advise them that the consumption of any alcoholic drinks are prohibited at the fields under both UMass and US Rugby policy.\n\nMission Statement:\n\n\tThe UMass Women\u2019s Rugby Team is a dedicated group of women competing against nationally recognized teams. We\u2019ve been invited to national tournaments as both a sevens and fifteens team across New England. We also host opposing teams to come play games on our campus. We play intercollegiate games in Massachusetts and in all surrounding states. Our games are played in both spring and fall semesters.  At our core, we are women finding a community to belong in UMass. In this sense, this club gives us a place in UMass\u2019 large campus as we give back to the UMass community as well.\n \nAlcohol Policy:\n\n\tPlayers are expected to train and to be in game condition throughout the season. Players are expected to refrain from using alcohol after Thursday night through Saturday during the season and for the entire week prior to Championships. We request that players voluntarily extend this restriction through Wednesday evenings so as to have removed the alcohol form their system by game day. Any player violating this policy or found using illegal substances will be suspended from playing until the Captains and Coaches can meet with the player to determine the appropriate remedy. Pursuant to both University policy and Massachusetts State Law, it is unlawful for any person under the age of 21. No player on the team should be providing alcoholic beverages to any underage person.\n\nHazing Policy:\n\tMassachusetts State Law prohibits hazing and makes it a criminal offense. If a player feels she has been subjected to hazing or if she has witnessed an act which she believes to be hazing it should immediately be reported to the coaching staff. The player\u2019s name filing the report will remain confidential. It is important to note that consent is not a defense to hazing and does not excuse the action.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution ", "Data": ""}]}, {"Name": "Rugby Club (W)", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "UMWRFC Constitution 2018", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "UMass Women's Rugby", "Data": ""}]}, {"Name": "Running Club", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "UMRCConstitution.doc", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "UMRCConstitution10-19539.doc", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "UMRC Constitution", "Data": ""}]}, {"Name": "S#arp Attitude", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}]}, {"Name": "SACL Finance", "DocsList": [{"Name": "2023-09-13 SE Deposit Form Upload.xlsx", "Data": ""}]}, {"Name": "Sailing Team", "DocsList": [{"Name": "Constitution/Bylaws", "Data": ""}, {"Name": "Sailing Team Constitution 2019_29_1.pdf", "Data": "Rev. 1/29/2019 by Eileen Devane, Eric Adams \nApproved 1/29/2019 \n\nUNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST \nCLUB SAILING TEAM \nEst. 1995 \n\nTEAM CONSTITUTION / BYLAWS \nFebruary 2018 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThis document outlines the policies and procedures each member of the University of \nMassachusetts Amherst Club Sailing Team (heretofore referred to as \u201cthe team\u201d) and the team as \na whole are expected to abide by. \n\nArticle I.\n\nTitle. \n\nSection 1. \n\nThe name of our organization is the University of Massachusetts Amherst Club \nSailing Team. \n\nArticle II. \n\nPurpose. \n\nSection 1. \n\nThe mission of the team is as follows: \n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nEducate students about the sport of sailing, including racing techniques.  \nEncourage participation in the sport of sailing. \nPromote campus participation and teamwork. \nFoster a strong bond between team members, past and present.  \nRace competitively within the New England Intercollegiate Sailing \nAssociation (NEISA). \n\nSection 2.\n\nThe team is affiliated with the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association \n(NEISA) as a provisional member. \n\nSection 3. \n\nThe team is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) at UMass, and a member of \nthe Club Sport Council (CSC). \n\nArticle III.

of their desire for an impeachment motion. \nAny EBoard member, elected or acting, shall have the opportunity to speak on impeachment motions before the general body after the motion has been seconded, in accordance with Roberts rules. \nEBoard members may only face one impeachment vote per general body meeting. \nRemoval of the entire EBoard may occur with \u2158 majority vote of the General Body, so long as the general body's current size (total members not members present) is not exceeded by the current EBoard. \nRemoval of a General Body Member may be initiated by a 2/3 vote of the general body unless the rationale for removal is otherwise protected within this document. \nThis will require a second\nAfter a second, the motion will immediately be considered.\nGeneral body

of its decision and rationale as to why confidence has been lost.\nThe secretary shall ask GEO or GSG to initiate internal recall procedures for these Ex-Officio members using their own internal

an acting EBoard member. \nAny General Body Member or other EBoards member may be eligible for appointment. \nResignation by Inaction: Any EBoard member who does not attend 3 consecutive EBoard and/or

National Philanthropy of Sigma Psi Zeta is to combat\nviolence against women in its varied forms. This includes,\nbut is not, by any means, limited to the following:\n3.1.A\nRape\nIncest\n3.1.B\nDomestic violence\n3.1.C\nSexual assault\n3.1.D\n3.1.E\nStalking\n3.1.F\nChild abuse\n3.1.G Harassment\n3.1.H Spousal abuse\nThrough our combined individual and group e\ufb00orts, we have\ndemonstrated a commitment to education and Asian unity. Any kind\nof physical, emotional or mental duress constitutes violence. In\norder to educate and inform ourselves and our communities, Sigma\nPsi Zeta takes a preventive and proactive stance where violence\nagainst women is concerned, rather than simply provide\nphilanthropic support.\nWe accomplish our National Philanthropy by:\n3.3.A\n\nVolunteering our time to domestic violence\nshelters,\nSponsoring or attending conferences and meetings\nthat empower women's rights,\nLending our ears to women that need this speci\ufb01c\n\n3.3.B\n\n3.3.C\n\n\fSigma Psi Zeta Sorority Inc. \u2013 Theta Charter 7\n\n3.3.D\n\n3.3.E\n\n3.3.F\n\ntype support and seeking help for them,\nHelping to stop violations against women refugees\nand asylum-seekers,\nAdvocating for political causes that a\ufb00ect\nsuch demographics,\nAttending and hosting self-defense workshops\nand classes,\n\n3.3.G Collaborating artistically and educationally with\n\nother women-of-color,\n\n3.3.H Donating proceeds of activities to organizations\n\n3.3.I\n\nthat support this same cause, and\nObtaining organizational memberships to human\nrights organizations.\n\nActivism is the means to uproot injustices. We cannot forget\nthat we are the heirs of two histories. One of our foremothers\nwho have built for us our cultural history in Asia, and another\nof the countless Asian-American women here who have\nforged a path for social justice and equality in the United\nStates. If it weren't for these brave women, we would not be\nenjoying the freedoms we have today. We must honor those\nAsian-American feminists by being advocates of their work\nand remembering that their dreams live in us.\nAlthough there are many noteworthy causes and\nphilanthropies, we believe that this is especially an important\none. By adopting this ethic within our sorority, we\nimmediately become involved in a demographic that we seek\nto advocate for \u23af one of the Asian female.\nIn addition, we encourage and empower ourselves as college\nstudents and alumnae. While this a\ufb04iction continues to\nhappen around the world, it is prevalent in American culture.\nAttacks are likely to happen to undergraduates at universities\nall across the nation. Violence a\ufb00ects the lives of millions of\nwomen worldwide, in all socio-economic and educational\nclasses. It cuts across cultural and religious barriers, impeding\nthe right of women to participate fully in society. Of course, in\nthis respect, ALL women \u23af Asian or non Asian \u23af when\nabused, still bleed, cry, and feel the same pain.\nSuch a violation of basic human rights is inexcusable. We\nstruggle as women to eradicate this form of oppression. Seeing\nas we will perhaps become the mothers of tomorrow, we might\nvery well have daughters someday that will bene\ufb01t from our\nstruggles for this worthy cause.\n\n3.4\n\n3.5\n\n3.6\n\n3.7\n\nARTICLE IV.\n\nMEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS\n\nSection 1.\n\nEligibility for Membership\n\n1.1\n\nEligibility for membership shall not, in any way, be a\ufb00ected\nor determined by race, color, religion, age, physical disability,\nethnic background, sexual orientation, creed, or national\norigin.\n\n\fSigma Psi Zeta Sorority Inc. \u2013 Theta Charter 8\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\nFurther provided that no woman shall be elected to\nmembership who is a member of another general national\ncollege Sorority or sorority.\nThe limitation stated in Article IV, Section 1.2 is waived when\nthis individual is a member of an honorary society or a pre\nprofessional Sorority, sorority, or association.

12) \n\nRULES OF ORDER FOR TOWN MEETING \n(ATM - March 20, 1939 - Art. 12) \n(STM \u2013 Oct. 27, 2003 \u2013 Art. 2) \n(ATM \u2013 May 1, 2006 \u2013 Art. 7) \n(STM \u2013 November 2, 2015 \u2013 Art. 5) \n\n1.  CONSENT CALENDAR.    At least five business days prior to the opening of the first \nsession of the Annual Town Meeting or any Special Town Meeting, the moderator shall propose \nto all members a \u201cConsent Calendar\u201d listing all articles and budget areas which, based on the \nrecords of recent town meetings, the moderator deems to be non-controversial. At the first \nsession of the meeting, at the request of any five members present, any article or budget area \nshall be removed from the Consent Calendar so that it can be debated and voted upon in \naccordance with the provisions of these Rules of Order. All items remaining in the Consent \nCalendar shall then be voted upon by a single vote without debate.  \n\n2.  Any motions shall be in writing if requested by the moderator. \n\n3.  Any question may be divided on call of a member when the sense will admit of such \ndivision. \n\n4.  GREEN AND RED CARDS DURING DEBATE.   To assist the moderator in shaping an \norderly and equitable debate, green and red cards shall be used by members to indicate a desire \nto speak for or against the current motion on the floor.

When a question is under debate, the moderator shall receive no motion but to adjourn, to \ndismiss, for the previous question, to postpone for a day certain, to commit, or to amend, which \nseveral motions shall have precedence in the order herein mentioned.  The meeting shall not vote \nto dismiss an article without having heard a voter speak in its favor, unless no one seeks to do so. \n\n6.  Following a motion under any article, the Moderator shall first recognize the proponent \nthereof to speak for up to five (5) minutes in favor of the motion, or with leave of Town Meeting, \nfor additional time.  Thereafter, and in the absence of leave of Town Meeting granting additional \ntime, each subsequent speaker shall be limited to three (3) minutes.

Procedure if Electronic Voting is available: An Electronic Tally shall  be taken. For an \nElectronic Tally, the Clerk will record the name and vote of each member,  along with the total \nreceived ayes noes and abstentions.  This vote shall be determinative of the question. Each \nmember shall cast his/her own vote only. \n\n8.b.  Procedure if Electronic Voting is not available: The vote shall be taken by a counted \nstanding vote unless, within a short but reasonable period of time following the voice vote, \nwhich period of time shall be fixed by the moderator, any member requests a tally vote and if 14 \nmembers manifest their concurrence with that member, in which case the vote of each member \nshall  be tallied by the use of a color-coded (green for aye, red for no) card. Each such card shall \nbear the  member's name and indicate his/her vote. Each member shall cast his/her own vote \nonly. Such cards shall be collected and counted by the tellers, which count shall be determinative \nof the question. \n\n9.  A vote may be reconsidered only on motion of a member who did not vote with the minority.  \nWhen a motion for reconsideration is decided that decision shall not be reconsidered, and no \nquestion shall be twice reconsidered. \n\n10.

The tether must be designed for dogs (e.g., logging \nchains and other lines or devices not for the purpose of tethering dogs may not be used). No \nchain or tether shall weigh more than one-eighth (1/8) of the dog\u2019s body weight. Nothing in this \nsection shall be construed as prohibiting a person from walking a dog on a hand-held leash. \n\nNo dog under the age of six (6) months shall be tethered outside for any length of time.  \n\n(B) Permissible Outside Confinement.  \nA person owning or keeping a dog in the town may confine such dog outside, subject to the \nrestrictions stated elsewhere in this by-law, through the use of any of the following three \nmethods: \n\n(1) Inside a pen or secure enclosure, if the following conditions are met:  \n\n32 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f(a) The pen or secure enclosure has adequate space for exercise with a dimension of at \nleast one hundred (100) square feet.

Local landfills are running out of room; our future solid waste may have to be \ntransported hundreds of miles to a landfill at considerable cost. \n\nExpanded polystyrene food containers are not recyclable, nor are they biodegradable. \nOnce buried in our landfills, they will persist for centuries.  \n\nStyrene, the key ingredient in expanded polystyrene, was recently added to the National \nToxicology Program\u2019s list of carcinogens (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services).   \nStyrene can leach from polystyrene containers into food and beverages.    \n\nMany communities in the United States have banned expanded polystyrene food containers, \nincluding Seattle WA, Freeport Maine, Great Barrington MA and Nantucket MA. \n\nApproximately 60% of Amherst food establishments have already stopped using expanded \npolystyrene food containers.    \n\nUniversity of Massachusetts/Amherst, Amherst College, and Hampshire College food services \nhave eliminated single-use expanded polystyrene food containers from their dining halls. \n\nAppropriate alternative products are readily available from the vendors used by local food \nestablishments; cooperative bulk buying arrangements are possible. \n\nThus, elimination of expanded polystyrene food containers is in the best interest of the health and \nwelfare of Town inhabitants. \n\nSECTION 4   DEFINITIONS \n\u201cDisposable Food Service Container\u201d means single-use disposable products for serving or \ntransporting prepared, ready-to-consume food or beverages. This includes but is not limited to \nplates, cups, bowls, trays and hinged or lidded containers. This definition does not include \nsingle-use disposable items such as straws, cup lids, or utensils, nor does it include single-use \ndisposable packaging for unprepared foods. \n\n43 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\u201cFood Establishment\u201d means an operation that stores, prepares, packages, serves, vends, or \notherwise provides food for human consumption, as further defined in 105 CMR 590.002.  Any \nestablishment requiring a permit to operate in accordance with the State Food Code, 105 CMR \n590.000, et. seq., shall be considered a Food Establishment for purposes of this bylaw. \n\n\u201cExpanded Polystyrene\u201d (EPS) means polystyrene that has been expanded or \u201cblown\u201d using a \ngaseous blowing agent into a solid foam. \n\n\u201cPolystyrene\u201d means expanded polystyrene which is a thermoplastic petrochemical material \nutilizing a styrene monomer and processed by any number of techniques including, but not \nlimited to, fusion of polymer spheres (expandable bead polystyrene), injection molding, form \nmolding, and extrusion-blow molding (extruded foam polystyrene). The term \u201cpolystyrene\u201d also \nincludes clear or solid polystyrene which is known as \u201coriented polystyrene\u201d. \n\n\u201cPrepared Food\u201d means any food or beverage prepared for consumption on the Food \nEstablishment\u2019s  premises, using any cooking or food preparation technique. This does not \ninclude any raw uncooked meat, fish or eggs unless provided for consumption without further \nfood preparation. \n\n\u201cTown Facility\u201d means any building, structure, land or park owned or operated by the Town of \nAmherst, its agents and departments. \n\n\u201cTown Facility Users\u201d means all persons, societies, associations, organizations or special event \npromoters who require a permission to use a Town Facility.  Town Facility Users also includes \nconcession contracts with the Town, Town-managed concessions, Town-sponsored events and \nfood services provided at the Town\u2019s expense. \n\nSECTION 5  PROHIBITION \nA. Except as provided herein, Food Establishments are prohibited from dispensing Prepared \nFood to customers in Disposable Food Service containers made from Expanded Polystyrene. \n\nB. Town Facility Users are prohibited from dispensing Prepared Food to customers in \nDisposable Food Service containers made from Expanded Polystyrene. \n\nSECTION 6   DEFERMENTS \nA. Upon written application, the Board of Health, after a public hearing, may defer application of \nthis Bylaw for a Food Establishment for a one year period, upon a showing by the Food \nEstablishment that the conditions of this Bylaw would cause undue hardship.  For purposes of \nthis Bylaw, an \u201cundue hardship\u201d is a situation unique to the Food Establishment where there are \nno reasonable alternatives to the use of expanded polystyrene disposable food service containers \nand compliance with this provision would cause significant economic hardship to that Food \nEstablishment. \n\n44 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\fB. A Food Establishment granted a deferment by the Town must reapply prior to the end of the \none year exemption period and demonstrate continued undue hardship, if it wishes to have the \ndeferment extended.  Deferments may only be granted for intervals not to exceed one year.   \n\nC. A deferment granted in accordance with this Section may be extended for no more than one \nadditional one year period, upon written application to the Board of Health at least two months \nprior to the expiration of the first deferment period and upon a showing that the circumstances \njustifying the deferment continue to exist. \n\nD. A deferment application shall include all information necessary for the Town to make its \ndecision, including, but not limited to, documentation showing the factual support for the \nclaimed deferment. The Board of Health may require the applicant to provide additional \ninformation to permit it to determine facts regarding the deferment application. \n\nE. The Board of Health may approve the deferment application, in whole or in part, with or \nwithout conditions that it deems necessary to protect the public health and further the interests of \nthis Bylaw. \n\nF.    Deferment decisions are effective immediately and final. \n\nSECTION 7   ENFORCEMENT \nA. The Health Department or its designee shall inquire on an annual basis regarding any food \nestablishment\u2019s compliance with this bylaw as a condition for renewal of the establishment\u2019s \nfood service permit.   \n\nB. The Board of Health, after a hearing conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in \n105 CMR 590.14 and 105 CMR 590.15, may suspend or revoke the food service permit for any \nestablishment failing to comply with this bylaw. \n\nC. The Health Department or its designee shall have primary responsibility for enforcement of \nthis provision and shall have authority to issue citations for violation(s).  The Health Department \nor its designee is authorized to establish regulations or administrative procedures and to take any \nand all actions reasonable and necessary to further the purposes of this chapter or to obtain \ncompliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, inspecting any vendor\u2019s premises to \nverify compliance in accordance with applicable law. \n\nD. The Health Department may enforce this by-law or enjoin violations thereof through any \nlawful process, and the election of one remedy by the Health Department shall not preclude \nenforcement through any other lawful means. \n\nE. Penalties and Fines for Violations  \nViolations of this ordinance may be enforced as follows: \n\n1.  This bylaw shall be enforced by the Health Department or its designee, including the \nDepartment of Public Works.  Whoever violates any provision of this bylaw may be penalized by \n\n45 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fa non-criminal disposition process as provided in G.L. c.40, \u00a721D and the Town\u2019s non-criminal \ndisposition bylaw.  If non-criminal disposition is elected, then any person who violates any \nprovision of this bylaw shall be subject to the following penalties:  \n\nFor the first violation, the Health Department or its designee, upon determination that a violation \nhas occurred, shall issue a written warning notice to the food establishment which will specify \nthe violation and the appropriate penalties in the event of future violations. \n\nThereafter, the following penalties shall apply: \n\n(a). A fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the first violation following the issuance of a \nwarning notice. \n\n(b). A fine of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for the second and any other violation that \noccurs following the issuance of a warning notice. \n\n2.  Fines are cumulative and each day or portion thereof shall constitute a separate offense.  If \nmore than one, each condition violated shall constitute a separate offense. \n\n3.  Whoever violates any provision of this bylaw may be penalized by indictment or on \ncomplaint brought in the district court.  Except as may be otherwise provided by law and as the \ndistrict court may see fit to impose, the maximum penalty for each violation or offense shall be \nthree hundred dollars.  \n\nPUBLIC WORKS \n\n1.  Disturbing Highway Surface or Curbing  (STM - November 3, 1969 - Art. 17) \nNo person shall make any excavation in any public way, disturb its curbing or pavement, pave any \nunpaved portion  thereof, or remove earth or  gravel  therefrom, without first  obtaining a  written \npermit therefor from the town manager, and no person who has received such a permit shall violate \nany restrictions or conditions contained therein. \n\n2.

No prosecution for violations pertaining to Article II (except Dog Regulations) shall be \ncommenced after sixty (60) days from the commission thereof. \n\nWETLANDS PROTECTION \n(ATM - April 27, 1987 - Art. 54) \n(ATM - April 28, 1999 - Art. 30) \n(ATM \u2013 May 2, 2011 \u2013 Art. 26) \n\nI. Purpose \n  The purpose of this bylaw is to protect the wetlands, water resources, and adjoining land areas \nin the Town of Amherst by controlling activities deemed by the Conservation Commission likely \nto have a significant or cumulative effect upon resource area values, including but not limited to \nthe following: public and private water supply, groundwater, flood control, erosion and \nsedimentation control, storm damage prevention, water quality, water pollution prevention, \nwildlife habitat, rare species habitat including rare plant species, agriculture, aquaculture, and \nrecreation values, deemed important to the community (collectively, the \u201cresource area values \nprotected by this bylaw\u201d).  This bylaw is intended to utilize the Home Rule authority of this \nmunicipality to protect additional resource areas, for additional values, with additional standards \nand procedures stricter than those of the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. c. 131 Sec. 40) and \nRegulations thereunder (310 CMR 10.00 et seq.). \n\nII. Jurisdiction \n  Except as permitted by the Conservation Commission or as provided in this bylaw, no person \nshall commence to remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade, discharge into, or otherwise alter \nthe following resource areas: any freshwater wetland; marsh; wet meadow; bog; swamp; isolated \nwetland; vernal pool; bank; reservoir; pond; river; perennial stream; intermittent stream; \nwatercourse; water within water bodies; land under water bodies; land subject to flooding or \ninundation by groundwater, surface water, or storm flowage; and land abutting any of the \naforesaid resource areas as set out in VII.4 below (collectively the \u201cresource areas protected by \nthis bylaw\u201d).  Said resource areas shall be protected whether or not they border surface waters. \n\nIII. Conditional Exceptions \n  The application and permit required by this bylaw shall not be required for maintaining, \nrepairing, or replacing, but not substantially changing or enlarging, an existing and lawfully \nlocated structure or facility used in the service of the public to provide electric, gas, telephone, \ntelegraph, or other telecommunication services, or sanitary or storm sewers, provided that written \nnotice has been given to the Commission prior to the commencement of work, and provided that \nthe work conforms to performance standards and design specifications in regulations adopted by \nthe Commission. \n\n47 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f  The application and permit required by this bylaw shall not be required for work performed \nfor normal maintenance or improvement of land which is lawfully in agricultural use at the time \nthe work takes place. \n\n  The application and permit required by this bylaw shall not be required for emergency \nprojects necessary for the protection of the health or safety of the public, provided that the work \nis to be performed by or has been ordered to be performed by an agency of the Commonwealth \nor a political subdivision thereof; provided that advance notice, oral or written, has been given to \nthe Commission, prior to commencement of the work or within 24 hours after commencement; \nprovided that the Commission or its agent certifies the work as an emergency project; provided \nthat the work is performed only for the time and place certified by the Commission for the \nlimited purposes necessary to abate the emergency; and provided that within 21 days of \ncommencement of an emergency project a permit application shall be filed with the Commission \nfor review as provided by this bylaw.  Upon failure to meet these and other requirements of the \nCommission, the Commission may, after notice and a public hearing, revoke or modify an \nemergency project approval and order restoration and mitigation measures. \n\nThe application and permit required by this bylaw shall not be required for exemptions \n\nunder the Rivers Act (310 CMR 10.58).  \n\nOther than stated in this section, the exceptions provided in the Wetlands Protection Act \n(G.L. c. 131 Sec. 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00 et seq.) shall not apply under this bylaw. \n\nIV.  Applications for Permits (Notice of Intent or NOI) and Requests for Determination \n(RFD)  \n  Written application shall be filed with the Commission to perform activities affecting resource \nareas protected by this bylaw.  The permit application shall include such information and plans \nas are deemed necessary by the Commission to describe proposed activities and their effects on \nthe resource areas protected by this bylaw.  No activities shall commence without receiving and \ncomplying with a permit issued pursuant to this bylaw. \n\n  The Commission in an appropriate case may accept as the permit application and plans under \nthis bylaw the Notice of Intent and plans filed under the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. c. 131 \nSec. 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00 et seq.). \n\n  Any person desiring to know whether or not a proposed activity or an area is subject to this \nbylaw may request in writing a determination from the Commission.  Such a Request for \nDetermination (hereafter RFD) shall include information and plans as are deemed necessary by \nthe Commission. \n\nAt the time of a permit (NOI) or RFD Application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee \nspecified in the Regulations of the Commission.  The fee is in addition to that required by the \nWetlands Protection Act (G.L. c. 131 Sec. 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00 et seq.).  The \nfiling fee shall be commensurate with the reasonable expenses incident to the licensing. \n\n48 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f  Upon receipt of a permit application or RFD, or at any point during the hearing process, the \nCommission is authorized to require an applicant to pay a fee for the reasonable costs and \nexpenses borne by the Commission for specific expert engineering and other consultant services \ndeemed necessary by the Commission to come to a final decision on the application.  This fee is \ncalled the \u201cconsultant fee.\u201d  The specific consultant services may include, but are not limited to, \nperforming, or verifying the accuracy of, resource area survey and delineation; analyzing \nresource area functions and values, including wildlife habitat evaluations, hydrogeologic and \ndrainage analysis; and researching environmental or land use law. \n\n  The Commission may require the payment of the consultant fee at any point in its \ndeliberations prior to a final decision.   Any unused portion of the consultant fee shall be returned \nto the applicant unless the Commission decides at a public meeting that additional services will \nbe required.   \n\nThe Commission may waive the filing fee, consultant fee, and costs and expenses for a permit \n\napplication or RFD filed by a government agency. \n\nV. Notice and Hearings \n  Any person filing a permit application or a RFD with the Commission at the same time shall \ngive written notice thereof, by certified mail (return receipt requested), or certificates of mailing, \nor hand delivered, to all abutters at their mailing addresses shown on the most recent applicable \ntax list of the assessors, including owners of land directly opposite on any public or private street \nor way, and abutters to the abutters within 300 feet of the property line of the applicant, \nincluding any in another municipality or across a body of water. \nThe notice to abutters shall have enclosed a copy of the permit application or request, with plans, \nor shall state where copies may be examined and obtained by abutters.  An affidavit of the person \nproviding such notice, with a copy of the notice mailed or delivered, shall be filed with the \nCommission.  When a person requesting a determination is other than the owner, the request, the \nnotice of the hearing, and the determination itself shall be sent by the Commission to the owner \nas well as to the person making the request. \n\n  The Commission shall conduct a public hearing on any permit application or RFD, with \nwritten notice given at the expense of the applicant, five business days prior to the hearing, in a \nnewspaper of general circulation in the Town of Amherst. \n\n  The Commission shall commence the public hearing within 21 days from receipt of a \ncompleted permit application or RFD unless an extension is authorized in writing by the \napplicant. \n\nThe Commission shall issue its permit or determination in writing within 21 days of the close \n\nof the public hearing thereon unless an extension is authorized in writing by the applicant. \n\nThe Commission in an appropriate case may combine its hearing under this bylaw with the \nhearing conducted under the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. c. 131 Sec. 40) and Regulations (310 \nCMR 10.00 et seq.). \n\n49 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f  The Commission shall have the authority to continue the hearing to a certain date announced \nat the hearing or to an unspecified date, for reasons stated at the hearing, which may include the \nanticipated or requested receipt of additional information from the applicant or others deemed \nnecessary by the Commission in its discretion, or comments and recommendations of the boards \nand officials listed in VI below.  If the hearing is postponed to an unspecified date, the applicant \nis responsible for the expense of advertising the rescheduled hearing, such notice to appear five \nbusiness days prior to the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town of Amherst.  \nIn addition, the applicant must send written notice of the rescheduled hearing to any person who \nhas requested it. \n\n VI. Coordination with Other Boards \n  Any person filing a permit application or RFD with the Commission shall provide a copy \nthereof at the same time, by certified mail (return receipt requested), or certificates of mailing, or \nhand delivery, to the zoning board, planning board, health inspections, town engineer and \nbuilding commissioner. \nA copy shall be provided in the same manner to the Conservation Commission of the adjoining \nmunicipality, if the application or RFD pertains to property within 300 feet of that municipality.  \nAn affidavit of the person providing notice, with a copy of the notice mailed or delivered, shall \nbe filed with the Commission.  The Commission shall not take final action until the boards and \nofficials have had 14 days from receipt of notice to file written comments and recommendations \nwith the Commission, which the Commission shall take into account but which shall not be \nbinding on the Commission.  The applicant shall have the right to receive any comments and \nrecommendations, and to respond to them at a hearing, prior to final action. \n\nVII.  Permits and Conditions \n  The Commission shall have the authority, after a public hearing, to determine whether a \nspecific parcel of land contains or does not contain resource areas protected under this bylaw.  If \nthe Commission finds that no such resource areas are present, it shall issue a negative \ndetermination. \n\nIf the Commission, after a public hearing, determines that the activities which are subject to \nthe permit application, or the land and water uses which will result therefrom, are likely to have a \nsignificant individual or cumulative effect upon the resource area values protected by this bylaw, \nthe Commission, within 21 days of the close of the hearing, shall issue or deny a permit for the \nactivities requested.  If it issues a permit, the Commission shall impose conditions which the \nCommission deems necessary or desirable to protect those values, and all activities shall be done \nin accordance with those conditions.  The Commission shall take into account the cumulative \nadverse effects of loss, degradation, isolation, and replication of protected areas throughout the \ncommunity and the watershed, resulting from past activities, permitted and exempt, and \nforeseeable future activities. \n\n  The Commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements of this \nbylaw; for failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the Commission; for \nfailure to meet the design specifications, performance standards, and other requirements in \nregulations of the Commission; for failure to avoid or prevent unacceptable significant or \ncumulative effects upon the resource area values protected by this bylaw; and where no \n\n50 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fconditions are adequate to protect those values.  Due consideration shall be given to any \ndemonstrated hardship on the applicant by reason of denial, as presented at the public hearing. \n\n  Lands within 200 feet of rivers and within 100 feet of other resource areas, are presumed \nimportant to the protection of these resources because activities undertaken in close proximity to \nresource areas have a high likelihood of adverse impact upon the wetland or other resource, \neither immediately, as a consequence of construction, or over time, as a consequence of daily \noperation or existence of the activities.  These adverse impacts from construction and use can \ninclude, without limitation, erosion, siltation, loss of groundwater recharge, poor water quality, \nand loss of wildlife habitat.  The Commission therefore may require that the applicant maintain a \nstrip of continuous, undisturbed vegetative cover within, or in some instances up to the full \nextent of the 200-foot or 100-foot buffer area, unless the applicant convinces the Commission \nthat the area or part of it may be disturbed without harm to the values protected by the bylaw. \n\n  To prevent wetlands loss, the Commission shall require applicants to avoid wetlands \nalteration wherever feasible; shall minimize wetlands alteration; and, where alteration is \nunavoidable, shall require full mitigation.  The Commission may authorize or require replication \nof wetlands on a two-to-one basis as a form of mitigation, but only with adequate security, \nprofessional design, and monitoring to assure success, because of the high likelihood of failure of \nreplication. \n\n  A permit shall expire three years from the date of issuance.  Notwithstanding the above, the \nCommission at its discretion may issue a permit expiring five years from the date of issuance for \nrecurring or continuous maintenance work, provided that annual notification of time and location \nof work is given to the Commission prior to such work.  Any permit may be renewed once for an \nadditional one year period, provided that a request for a renewal is received in writing by the \nCommission prior to expiration.  Notwithstanding the above, a permit may contain requirements \nwhich shall be enforceable for a stated number of years, indefinitely, or until permanent \nprotection is in place, and shall apply to all owners of the land. \n\n  For good cause the Commission may revoke or modify a permit or determination issued under \nthis bylaw after public notice to the holder of the permit or determination, notice to the public \nand town boards, pursuant to V and VI above, and a public hearing. \n\n  The Commission in an appropriate case may combine the permit or determination issued \nunder this bylaw with the Order of Conditions or Determination of Applicability issued under the \nWetlands Protection Act (G.L. c. 131 Sec. 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00 et seq.). \n\n  No work proposed in any permit application shall be undertaken until the permit issued by the \nCommission with respect to such work has been recorded in the registry of deeds or, if the land \naffected is registered land, in the registry section of the land court for the district wherein the \nland lies, and until the holder of the permit certifies in writing to the Commission that the permit \nhas been recorded. \n\n VIII. Regulations \n\n51 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f  After public notice and public hearing, the Commission shall promulgate rules and regulations \nto effectuate the purposes of this bylaw effective when voted and filed with the town clerk.  The \nCommission may amend the rules and regulations after public notice and public hearing.  Failure \nby the Commission to promulgate such rules and regulations or a legal declaration of their \ninvalidity by a court of law shall not act to suspend or invalidate the effect of this bylaw.  Unless \notherwise stated in this bylaw or in the rules and regulations promulgated under this bylaw, the \ndefinitions, procedures, and performance standards of the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. c. 131 \nSec. 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00 et seq.) as most recently promulgated shall apply. \n\nIX.

Incremental activities which have, or may have, a cumulative adverse impact on the resource \n\nareas protected by this bylaw. \n\nX. Security \n  As part of a permit issued under this bylaw, in addition to any security required by any other \nmunicipal or state board, agency, or official, the Commission may require that the performance \nand observance of the conditions imposed thereunder (including conditions requiring mitigation \nwork) be secured wholly or in part by one or both of the methods described below: \n\nA.  By a proper bond or deposit of money or negotiable securities or other undertaking of \n\nfinancial responsibility sufficient in the opinion of the Commission, to be released in whole \nor in part upon issuance of a Certificate of Compliance for work performed pursuant to the \npermit. \n\nB.  By accepting a conservation restriction, easement, or other covenant enforceable in a court of \nlaw, executed and duly recorded by the owner of record, running with the land to the benefit \nof this municipality whereby the permit conditions shall be performed and observed before \nany lot may be conveyed other than by mortgage deed.  This method shall be used only with \nthe consent of the applicant. \n\nXI.  Enforcement \n  No person shall remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade, or otherwise alter resource areas \nprotected by this bylaw, or cause, suffer, or allow such activity, or leave in place unauthorized \nfill, or otherwise fail to restore illegally altered land to its original condition, or fail to comply \nwith a permit or an enforcement order issued pursuant to this bylaw. \n\n  The Commission, its agents, officers, and employees shall have authority to enter upon \nprivately owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this bylaw and may make \nor cause to be made such examinations, surveys, or sampling as the Commission deems \nnecessary, subject to the constitutions and laws of the United States and the Commonwealth. \n\nThe Commission shall have authority to enforce this bylaw, its regulations, and permits \n\nissued thereunder by violation notices, administrative orders, and civil and criminal court \nactions.  Any person who violates provisions of this bylaw may be ordered to restore the \nproperty to its original condition and take other action deemed necessary to remedy such \nviolations, or may be fined, or both. \n\nUpon request of the Commission, the board of selectmen and the town counsel shall take \n\nlegal action for enforcement under civil law.  Upon request of the Commission, the chief of \npolice shall take legal action for enforcement under criminal law. \n\nMunicipal boards and officers, including any police officer or other officer having police \n\npowers, shall have authority to assist the Commission in enforcement. \n\nAny person who violates any provision of this bylaw, or regulations, permits, or \n\nadministrative orders issued thereunder, or has failed to obtain the necessary Commission \n\n53 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fapproval, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $300.  Each day or portion thereof during \nwhich a violation continues, or unauthorized fill or other alteration remains in place, shall \nconstitute a separate offense, and each provision of the bylaw, regulations, permits, or \nadministrative orders violated shall constitute a separate offense. \n\nXII.  Burden of Proof \n  The applicant for a permit shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the credible \nevidence that the work proposed in the permit application will not have unacceptable significant \nor cumulative effect upon the resource area values protected by this bylaw.  Failure to provide \nadequate evidence to the Commission supporting this burden shall be sufficient cause for the \nCommission to deny a permit or grant a permit with conditions. \n\nXIII. Appeals \n  A decision of the Commission shall be reviewable in accordance with G.L. c. 249 Sec. 4. \n\nXIV.  Relation to the Wetlands Protection Act \n  This bylaw is adopted under the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution \nand the Home Rule statutes, independent of the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. c. 131 Sec. 40) \nand Regulations (310 CMR 10.00 et seq.) thereunder. \n\nXV.

Definitions  As used in this by-law the following terms shall have the following \nmeanings: \n\na)  \"Board\": The Board of Selectmen \n\nb)  \u201ccondominium unit\u201d:  a unit of a condominium, as defined in Chapter 183A of the General \n\nLaws. \n\nc)  \u201ccooperative unit\": a residential dwelling space in a building owned by a corporation, the \n\nshareholders of which have organized on a cooperative basis for the purpose of leasing such \ndwelling space to themselves. \n\nd)  \"condominium conversion\": the sale, of a condominium unit in a building, by the owner of \n\nsaid building. \n\n65 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fe)  \u201ccooperative conversions\": the execution of a lease, of a cooperative unit in a building, with \n\nan owner of shares of stock in the corporation which owns the building. \n\nSECTION 3.  Applicability  This by-law shall apply to all buildings located within the town \nwhich contain two or more units of rental housing, whether or not said units are occupied.  \nHowever, no unit once lawfully converted to a condominium or cooperative, and lawfully \noccupied by its owner, thereafter shall be governed by this by-law.  Notwithstanding section 4(a) \nhereof, this by-law shall not apply to units as to which master deeds have been filed prior to the \neffective date of this by-law. \n\nSECTION 4.   Regulation \n\na)  No condominium or cooperative conversion is permitted in the town, except pursuant to a \n\nconversion permit granted under subsections 4(b) and 4(c) hereof.

To do this, we will involve more general body members. We strive to do this through continuing to expand our existing programming which currently offers students the chance to become involved with or showcase their dancing, designing, modeling and much more. We also plan on creating different ways for people to get involved. Going forward, we want to give more opportunities to the musicians in the area by holding competitions where the winner would be decided by our general body. It creates a sense of investment in the organization for general body members, while allowing for a different way to get involved for those who do not want to be front and center. Regardless of who wins, these competitions give artists an opportunity to promote and practice their craft and network with other artist on campus. For those who are more interested in working behind the scenes, we plan on training general body members on becoming stagehands that can help in running some of our bigger events. This again creates a sense of investment, fosters community, and ensures we have a way for anyone to get involved.

The results are then declared to the entire group or at the following group meeting and through a group e-mail.\n\nArticle VI: Meetings\n\nThe Executive Board will decide when the meetings for the entire group should be held based on a democratic vote from the club members. This vote should occur at the beginning of every semester.\nMeetings should be bi-weekly, however may vary depending on the scheduling of Special Olympics events.\nThe Presidents may also call special meetings involving the entire group when he/she deems it necessary. These meetings shall be called with no less than twenty-four hours notice. \nThe Co-Presidents chair all meetings of the group and the Executive Board meetings, except for individual committee meetings. In the absence of a President, the Vice-President may take the place of a President for the meeting.\nNo meetings will occur during University holidays or during Final Exam periods.\nMembers of the club must attend at least three meetings during an academic semester.\n\nArticle VII: Removal of Member(s) and/or Executive Board Member(s)\n\nThe Executive Board withholds the rights to remove a member from the club if the member is not fully participating and/or causing unwarranted disturbances within the club.\nA member can fall under such circumstances requiring removal by not attending three group meetings.\nAll other circumstances that call for group member removal will be judged on an issue-by-issue basis.\nIf someone feels violated by another group member, they are requested to approach someone on the Executive Board and state their problem.  The officer that receives the complaint will take the issue to the Presidents who will thereafter bring it to the attention of the Executive Board.\nThe Executive Board will address the group member through a formal e-mail, requesting a meeting with the Executive Board where the group member in question will be given a chance to plead their case. The member or person who filed the complaint will be e-mailed separately, asking them to file their own case but will not be asked to attend the meeting with the group member in question.\nThe Executive Board will listen to the case of the members, and proceed forward on a case-by-case basis. After discussing the issue without the group members present, the Executive Board will vote on whether the person will be allowed to stay in the group or not. The group member in question will be notified by e-mail no later than a week after their hearing.\nIf an Executive Board member fails to attend two or more consecutive meetings or events and has no valid explanation for such absences, the Executive Board retains the ability to suspend or completely remove the officer, reopening their position for election.\nThe Executive Board will have a private meeting to discuss this issue as well as the severity of the offense by the officer under questioning. Then, the officer who is under scrutiny will be allowed to plead their case to the Executive Board at a second meeting where the Executive Board, after hearing the plea, can decide what terms this board member will work under for the rest of their time in office.\nThe Executive Board will vote after discussion of the Executive Board member in question pleads their case. If the severity of the issue does not seem to be major, then the officer will be allowed to stay under his or her title with a warning and minimal authority. However, if the issue is concluded to be severe enough, the officer will be removed from their title and the club, causing an empty seat in the Executive Board. See Article IV for elections for vacant officer seats for further proceedings.\n\nArticle VIII: Free Speech\n\nAll member of SO UMass are entitled to freedom of speech and will not under any circumstances be deprived of the opportunity to share their opinion to the group.\n\nArticle IX: Resolving Disputes\n\nDisputes arising between members on matters of the SO UMass policy shall be dealt with through majority votes of the general membership. \nDisputes arising between members on other matters shall be dealt with through mediation. \nMediation consists of a meeting involving both parties and a mediator with the purpose of coming to a solution and putting the issue to rest.\nThe President of Administration shall mediate disputes between members.\nShould the President of Administration be involved in the dispute, either the President of Finances or the President of Events may mediate. Should either party not be satisfied by the result of the mediation, any party may request that the Secretary of Registry mediate. The results of the mediation with the Secretary of the Registry shall be final. \n\nArticle X: Amendements\n\nAny group member may propose an amendment to this constitution by submitting the proposal in writing to the President of Administration or Secretary. Any proposal that is submitted will then be discussed and decided upon by the Executive Board at the next meeting through a democratic vote and a \u2154 majority of the Executive Board.\nIf majority is found in the Executive Board, the matter will be brought to the general membership for voting. The constitution will be amended with a \u2154 majority of the general membership.\nAfter being approved by the membership, the amendment itself, and an updated version of the Charter, shall be submitted to the Secretary of Registry for final approval.

Listening without judging or reacting to what is \nbeing said. Communicating attentiveness to the speaker with your facial expression and other non-\nverbal behaviors (nodding ones head, eye contact, attentive body posture, etc.). The main goal is \nhearing and receiving a message with understanding. \n\nPurposeful Sending \u2013 Giving out a message in a way that allows the intended message to be heard. \n\nParaphrasing \u2013 Stating what you heard using your own words so that the speaker knows the message \nwas received. At times you may need to ask clarifying questions to be sure you know what has been \nsaid. \n\nExamples of Paraphrasing: \n\nI heard you say that ______________ \nFrom what you said, it sounds like you felt _______________ \n\nExample of Asking Clarifying Questions: \n\nWhen you said _______________ did you mean _______ or __________? \n\nFeedback \u2013 Information to speaker about the effectiveness of communication by describing an \nobserved act of communication or behavior without judging the message or the person. It is specific. It \nis both affirming (positive) and constructive (about something you would like changed). \n\nFeedback to the Speaker and/or Listener \n\nI noticed that you did ___ when I or ____ said __________ \nI felt heard when you said ___________ or did ____________. \nI wasn\u2019t sure if you had heard me when I said ________or did_________. \nWhen you said/did ___________I felt_____________ because _________. \nWhen you said/did ____________ I felt____________ \n\nRoles: \nSpeaker \u2013 Sends a message to the listener using symbols that convey ideas and feelings. This message \nincludes both unconscious and conscious symbols that can be verbal as well as  non-verbal. \n\nListener \u2013 Hears what the speaker says and responds to the messages by paraphrasing or asking \nclarifying questions as a way of providing feedback to the speaker about the reception of the message \nheard. \n\nObserver \u2013 Observes how the speaker and listener communicate verbally and non-verbally. Focuses on \nthe use of words, actions or reactions of speaker and listener.

Club (Smash Club) 2019-2020\n\nAdopted __DATE__ in Amherst, MA\nMission Statement\n\nThe mission of the UMass Super Smash Bros. Club is to provide an avenue for Smash Bros. players to meet each other for both competitive and casual purposes. We provide a means for casual play, as well as tournaments, rankings, and prizes for the competitive players. The main focus of the club is on the two games with a large competitive scene, which are Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube (2001), and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch (2018). However, members are also encouraged to play and bring any Smash-style games they are interested in, including but not limited to Super Smash Bros. (N64, 1999), Project M (Wii, 2011), and Rivals of Aether (PC, 2017). Club meetings consist of playing the games, as well as coordinating travel to larger events, and running competitive brackets. Smash Club is a means for students to get together with fellow fans, learn to play in a competitive environment, and have an alternative to weekend partying.

We also encourage our members to take on\n\nleadership roles and actively involve themselves in the planning and organization of club\n\nevents, providing valuable experience and growth opportunities.\n\n\fGoals\n\nYear 1 - Grow Community and Expand Resources\n\n\u25cf Expand our resource library to include books representative of the plethora of game\n\nsystems that exist, as well as collect dice, figurines, and other tabletop tools for game use.\n\nWe plan to expand our resources for members by adding a few new books, manuals, and\n\ngaming tools to our library.\n\n\u25cf Collaborate with other RSO's on planned events, such as joint game nights or workshops.\n\n\u25cf Foster and grow a welcoming community for tabletop gaming here at UMass Amherst,\n\nthrough weekly meetings and events. Our main focus for this year will be on growing our\n\ncommunity of members and creating a welcoming environment for all.

Our budgets weren\u2019t always complete, sections would often get declined.\n\nOur financial strategy for this year and the future is to heavily refine our budget creation. We\n\nplan to greatly improve our methods for handling budget requests and guaranteeing that we\n\nsubmit a quality, well-thought-out, request. We must have a firm grasp and understanding on\n\nwhat supplies are necessary for our club so that our budgets reflect that, and we can look into\n\nfurther fundraising opportunities if we are not allotted the amount we need. Typically, we have\n\nreceived enough yearly funds, and have only needed to fundraise through our yearly Live\n\nStream. Our club is committed to providing the appropriate resources for our members to enjoy\n\nthe tabletop hobby, so prioritizing our fundraising efforts is a must.\n\nAnnual Fundraising Strategy\n\nFall: Submit budget request to the SGA\n\n$2,000-$3,000\n\nSpring: UMass Gives Community Live Stream event\n\n$200\n\nOur Annual Estimated Expenses\n\n1.

We write and organize events for the general public. There are three main purposes of our organization. First is to create and foster a community of life science graduate students from different programs/departments by collaborating on projects of common interest. Through inter-program peer-editing, committees, group meetings, and outreach events, students have many avenues to interact with one another on a frequent basis. Our group serves as a new network for life science graduate students. Second is to provide opportunities for graduate students to practice science communication and engage in outreach. Contributors write and edit blog posts geared toward a general adult audience (high school age and up) and/or organize in-person outreach events for people of all ages, allowing us to practice effectively communicating with non-scientists. Currently, science communication is not integrated into science training at the undergraduate or graduate level. This organization provides us with a regular means to practice writing for, and communicating with nonscientists in a collaborative atmosphere. Third is to introduce a broad range of scientific concepts to the general public both in person, and through a popular medium: the internet. We believe everyone should have access to science and we want to provide a bridge between academia and the general public. This will be accomplished by regularly organizing and participating in local outreach opportunities, as well as publishing life science-based blog posts on our website. This content will additionally be shared through a mailing list, social media, and with other science educators interested in using blog writing as a teaching tool. \nARTICLE II - Membership, Membership Fees, Non-Discrimination Policy\nSection 1 General Definition of Membership: Membership shall be open to University of Massachusetts Amherst students interested in writing about life science. \nSection 2 Active Membership: Active members are those who write two blog posts and edit four blog posts a year. Members can be considered active if they are contributing significantly in other ways (e.g., managing the website, administrative roles, outreach committee, etc). This definition is subject to change as we grow in contributor numbers. \nSection 3 Non-Discrimination Policy: That\u2019s Life Science does not discriminate for any purpose on the basis of race, ethnicity, linguistic abilities, religion, sexual identity, political affiliation, disability status, or marital status.\nSection 4 Membership Fees: Active members will not need to provide a fee at this time.\nARTICLE III - Officers, Duties, and Terms \nWe have three main officer positions who coordinate the Life Science Blog committees among themselves and with the University of Massachusetts Amherst. All new holders of these positions will need to attend any required GSS trainings. \nPresidents/Co-Chairs - The Presidents/Co-Chairs will be responsible for coordinating the That\u2019s Life Science committees and organizing the agenda for group meetings. Tasks that are not appropriate for established committees will be completed by the Presidents/Co-Chairs (e.g. organizing vote for the next Presidents or Co-Chairs, group emails). The Presidents/Co-Chairs may also help the GSS Representative to communicate with GSS or UMass Amherst administration. The Presidents/Co-chairs will update the constitution annually in time for GSO applications. \nTreasurer - The Treasurer will be responsible for managing finance related training, committee fund requests, donation campaigns, and updating all members on our budget each semester.\nGraduate Student Senate (GSS) Representative - The GSS Representative serves as the main liaison between That\u2019s Life Science and GSS. The Representative will coordinate creation of the annual funding requests and hold treasurer responsibilities. Any internal requests for money (e.g. domain name, food for group meeting, etc.) will need to be approved by the GSS Representative. \nARTICLE IV - Election and Appointment Procedures \nSection 1 Election Schedule: The election for all executive committee positions shall be held at the end of April of each year. The election day shall be announced immediately prior to the general meeting.\nSection 2 Nomination Schedule: 10 days before the election, a notice shall be thoroughly distributed by the Presidents/Co-Chairs to announce the election and to invite nominations for each position. (If the Presidents/Co-Chairs are running for reelection, an objective third party will be asked to coordinate the elections.)\nSection 3 Nomination Eligibility: Any active member may be nominated for any position. Any active member may nominate any active member including her/himself.\nSection 4 Nomination Acceptance: 8 days before the election, each nominee shall be given one day to accept or decline the nomination of her/his name. Each nominee shall be only permitted to accept a nomination for one full position only.\nSection 5 Campaigning Period: Beginning 7 days before the election, each nominee shall be permitted to forward a statement to the Presidents/Co-Chairs to be posted on a webpage devoted to nominees\u2019 statements.\nSection 6 Election Period: On days and times decided in the prior general meeting, a vote collection box shall be left in a neutral and secure area. A method for votes in absentia shall be determined in a general meeting. The group may also use anonymous voting via online means (e.g. Survey Monkey) if a group meeting is not possible. \nSection 7 Votes Counting: Votes shall be counted by a suitable, impartial third person.\nSection 8 Determinations: A winner shall receive a majority of votes. In the event of a tie, the leading candidates sharing the tie shall participate in a runoff election following the general procedures in sections 5 through 7.\nSection 9 Appointment Procedures: In the event of a sudden or continued vacancy in an executive position, the Chair may choose to appoint an active member to the position in a temporary manner until an election can be held for the position.\nARTICLE V - Meetings\nSection 1 General Meetings\nThere will be at least one general meeting per semester that will be held towards the end of the semester. The committees will meet more frequently throughout the semester, based on their individual tasks at hand.\nSection 2 Special Meetings\nGenerally, the Presidents/Co-chairs will call for and organize meetings. If need be, any blog member can call for a general meeting as well as a committee meeting, the latter being a more likely event. In order to call a meeting, a schedule polling website, such as Doodle, will be used to find a time when the largest amount of members can attend. All members will be notified via email about date and location of each meeting. \nSection 3 Rules of Conduct and Speech\nMeetings will be run by the officers who will prepare an agenda for that meeting (whether it\u2019s the Presidents/Co-Chairs, GSS Rep, or a committee). Any member can raise topics for discussion, including votes on decisions, ideas, and committee updates. Members and officers should always be respectful of one another when speaking.\nSection 4 Voting\nVoting for issues that require member consideration and/or are of significance will be carried out via anonymous online polling. A deadline will be set granting at least 3 days for members to vote. As members receive this time to vote on each matter, there will be no requirement for how many members need to vote for results to be valid. Passing a measure requires 51% of the votes, unless multiple options are debated in which case the measure with the highest number of votes will be passed.\nARTICLE VI - Rights and Privileges of Members \nSection 1 General Rights of Members\nAll members have the right to write posts for the blog and get peer feedback, as well as join whichever committee they wish to join.

We strive to serve the campus community of new and experienced cyclists. Our goal is to foster a venue where friends and teammates can share their enjoyment, and passion, for bicycle riding. We actively promote group rides, skills and mechanic lessons, and racing in the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference. We are an active standing USA Cycling Club. We hope that all club members can gather and grow as athletes and members of the community.\nMembership:\nAny full time UMass student (undergraduate and graduate) is welcome to join the club. All rider types can go on regular rides with the club and be part of the club. We especially encourage female and genderqueer athletes to join. For racing seasons all participating members are expected to purchase a season racing pass, or individual race registration. Each member is also expected to complete 4 hours of community service per academic year.\n\n\tBenefits + Rights of Membership:\n\tBeing part of the UMass Cycling Club entitles club members to many benefits on and off \nthe bike. The main benefit of being part of the club is access to scheduled group rides put \non by the club, and in conjunction with Northampton Cycling Club. Weekly rides hosted by the club, provide a scene for all levels of riders to ride recreationally or train for the racing season that we participate in. New riders are always encouraged to join us and are given advice and help on beginner rides (available when roads + weather are safe). Those riders that are more inclined to race and train, are given subsidized transportation and lodging, as well as registrations to Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference race weekends. All of our club events, such as the Orchard Hill MTB Race, are free for all UMass students to race as part of, with the goal of getting new riders to try out the sport in a localized and convenient setting. \nOff the bike, our club has multiple partnerships that enable us to make cycling more affordable and accessible. As part of our club\u2019s mission to grow the sport of cycling on campus, we provide a 45% discount to season passes to all women and genderqueer cyclists. We also provide 40% discounts on all team apparel (necessary for a comfortable and safe riding experience) to all club members. We also note the large cost of riding especially in terms of cycling equipment. Because of this, we provide a list of club owned loaner bicycles and trainers for members to use per their needs for the season. To extend our club\u2019s cycling season, and help to cover member costs, we own and provide seven club smart cycling trainers that are stored at our partner cycling shop, Laughing Dog Bicycles. Laughing Dog has provided our members and club with considerable discounts on all cycling products and bikes, in a mutual goal of opening access to cycling for UMass students. As our local partner club, Northampton Cycling Club (NCC) provides free membership to all UMass Cycling Club members. This highlights the large community of cyclists within the Pioneer Valley, and opens access to more riding opportunities. On top of all other club benefits, we attempt to reach out to relevant club partners/sponsors each year to achieve deals and discounts that can be accessed by our club members.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nFunding: \nYear to year, our club aims to be financially  solvent and sustainable, while being part of an expensive sport. Financially, we prioritize funding for our racing program. The cornerstone of our club, we believe that a strong racing program within the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference, allows for growth in riders and healthy camaraderie. To do this we try to subsidize lodging, travel costs, and registration costs for racing weekends. We offset these costs with rider season passes that are purchased on an as needed basis by club members. Along with necessary administrative costs, like USA Cycling dues, we also prioritize covering our yearly mountain bike race. This race is one of our main ways of highlighting the club and generating interest in riding on campus. Fees for women cyclists and UMass student are lowered to be more accessible. This race, and any other events that we put on as a club are meant to be self sustaining, and revenue generated will go back into funding the event in the upcoming year. Lastly, we expect that yearly there will be cycling kits reproduced for club members and alumni to buy. Club members usually buy through a self funded online store. Alumni and others usually purchase kits through our club directly or online. This provides us with one of our main revenue generators, along with the selling of other club merchandise, which enables us to fund many one time purchases and other administrative costs. Our club also pursues other methods of funding, such as approaching sponsors for funding or beneficial deals, in return for advertisement for those respective sponsors on our media and kits. For much of our funding we are reliant and appreciate the allocation process of the SGA.\nMeeting Process:\nOur club will hold weekly club meeting on Tuesdays at 7:30pm, located at Laughing Dog Bicycles. We will come together to discuss the weekly ride schedule, organize weekend race logistics, and talk shop. Club meetings will be communicated at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, through online club communication channels (such as Slack).\nOfficer Positions:\nSocial Media:\nResponsible for posting on our Instagram, Mailchimp, Slack, and Facebook with photo updates about the team, as well as taking photos at races and events. Social media officers will also collaborate with the sponsorship officer to give advocacy to our sponsors through social media. The Social Media maven updates all relevant info for the club website and makes sure that the domain is active and the site is accessible. Posts pictures and updates after every race/event. \n\nSponsorship:\nInvolves yearly reaching out to our sponsors. Presenting a professional request to new and previous sponsors for donations and club deals that benefit club members. Correspond with set sponsors to present their brand though our club clothing, at club events (like the OHill MTB Race, and promotion of sponsor brands on our media outlets. Works with social media officer in postings and sponsor collaborations.\n\nSecretary/Team Outreach:\nTakes meeting minutes, sends out informative emails and slack posts with reminders of upcoming events. They also send in travel forms, room requests, and travel cards for race weekends. As well, the secretary roll maintains the RSO Campus Pulse profile page. The Secretary is also responsible for general team outreach such as,keeping track of dues and payments, rental equipment (and agreements) for the team. In general, they are the ambassador between team members and officers. They also collect kit purchases and sends packages to buyers.\n\nEvent Coordinator:\nHelps to coordinate and organize club events, like the OHill MTB Race, and weekly club rides. Club rides are organized at the beginning of a season and should be planned to include at least one beginner/development ride, one MTB ride, and one road ride. THe event coordinator takes these rides and updates the club calendar. The Event Coordinator also develops revenue and awareness generating events. This is done by working with the sponsorship officer for awards, collaborating with other clubs and collegiate clubs to create a sustainable event, and communicating the events to the events with the university through campus pulse.\n\nTreasurer:\nWill work with Summit (our financial software) for the club. Responsible for\nkeeping track of all funds in + out of our accounts, holding safe all cash on hand, calculating event costs, and processing checks + purchase requests. Treasurer also develops the club budget at the beginning of the new year for the club sports board and SGA to review. Works to make the club financially solvent. The treasurer has signature responsibility.\n\nWomen\u2019s Team Coordinator:\nThe women\u2019s team coordinator is responsible for leading, and initially establishing, the women\u2019s side of the club.
