Chimps, with whom we share ~96% of our DNA, have a numerical memory faculty vastly superior to that of humans. They are stronger, faster, more agile, more ferocious than we could ever expect to be \u2014 the same holds true for gorillas and orangutans. In fact, our abilities pale in comparison to the rest of the Great Apes, almost as if we were an afterthought of evolution that didn't quite work out.Yet we thrive. Why? Our physical abilities are clearly inferior to those of apes. At least some of our cognitive abilities are known to be inferior to those of apes. But at some level of abstraction, humans emerge as the pinnacle of social beings.Is it our ability to communicate? Chimps laugh, dogs bare their teeth and wag their tails and bark and whine and cry and play, bees dance. As much as we'd like to think that they are what define a human, these traits are not uniquely human.Among all social behaviors, there is only one that sticks out as uniquely human: language. Chimps raised alongside human babies don't acquire human language, but the human babies do. Dogs and cats and parrots can all talk, but they cannot speak.Language is the human universal. Linguistics is the study of that universal.\u00a0The purpose of Linguistics Club is two-fold: we seek to supplement the linguistics major with extracurricular opportunities and also more generally to promote and enhance the study of language within the Five Colleges community. We stress that our over-arching goal is to provide an extracurricular outlet for all undergraduates interested in language-related topics, not just linguistics majors. Language study spans numerous fields and majors; we aim to bring students within these various related fields together through activities with broad appeal, such as movies, games, and entertaining talks.\u00a0Above all else, our goal is the promotion of language study for an academically diverse audience in an informal and fun atmosphere.",

    "NAME: Massachusetts Cares About Cancer.CATEGORIES: Registered Student Organizations, Service & Engagement Council.SUMMARY: This club focuses on donating money and goods to the Pediatric Cancer department of Massachusetts hospitals. Only 4% of federal funding for cancer research goes to childhood cancer, although 2,500 children die from cancer every year in the United States..DESCRIPTION: Massachusetts Cares club fundraises for pediatric cancer research and services, with a special focus on supporting the pediatric oncologists at Massachusetts General Hospital. We are looking for members that are interested in volunteering their time to help fundraise and meet once a month to brainstorm ways to raise money to donate towards saving children's lives.\u00a0Here is some background information on why donating money towards pediatric cancer research is so vital in the world today:It is true that more adults get cancer than children. However, cancer still takes the lives of more than 2,500 children in the United States every year. This number is too small and unprofitable to attract the attention of private industry.This means it is up to the taxpayers to fill the gap in this lack of interest yet only 4% of federal funding for cancer research goes to childhood cancer.Advances in this research have come a long way, from a survival rate close to none, to a survival rate over 75%. Despite these facts, most of survivors will still deal with chronic health issues throughout their life. The progress has been halted due to lack of funding.It is now in the hands of the general public to help push this research forward. Although the money we raise may be a scratch on the surface, our inspiration to others will be our biggest contribution.We achieve our goals by fundraising and donating items to Massachusetts hospitals. We raise money by hosting restaurant fundraisers, Judie's Art Bar paint nights, bake sales, and receiving money through small scale donation. We strive to improve the lives of pediatric cancer patients by making blankets and holiday cards to donate and taking trips to Ronald McDonald House.With our club's\u00a0aid the whole world could benefit, leading us to a day where childhood cancer is better understood and can be treated and maybe even prevented more effectively.\u00a0",

We compete for the National Collegiate Championship, beginning with Division I league competition in New England in the fall.\u00a0What is Rugby?The simple description of rugby is that it is \u201cjust football without the pads.\u201d In reality, rugby is much more complex than that. In fact, American Football is actually derived from rugby, so maybe we should be calling it \u201crugby with helmets.\u201dIn rugby, any player may handle the ball, but only backwards passes are allowed. If a player has possession of the ball, they must be ahead of their teammates in the field of play. There are no downs. When a tackle is made, play continues until a penalty is called, the ball goes out of bounds, or the half ends. Since rugby is continuous, all players must be skilled in both offensive and defensive strategy. There are no temporary substitutions.Each team has fifteen players who remain on the field for the duration of the game. Positions are divided into two classes: forwards and backs. Players numbers 1-8 are the forwards, or the pack, who during the game must drive the ball forward, gain or retain possession, and get the ball out to the backs, who perform various passing plays. Games are eighty minutes long, split into two forty-minute halves. Women\u2019s rugby is the only sport with rules that are exactly the same as its men\u2019s counterpart.\u00a0How do I join the UMass WRFC?To join the team, all you have to do is come down to the field for the practices. We practice in the evenings Monday through Friday on the fields behind McGuirk Football Stadium. We play games on Saturdays and some Sundays, with home games at the same location as our practices.Do not be worried if you have never played rugby before. The majority of the team did not play before college. We appreciate anyone who has the courage to try a new sport.To be able to participate fully, you need to have a mouthguard and cleats (any besides softball cleats).

Due to the difficulty of raising awareness about the group, she created a website to facilitate communication between students at universities and to provide suggestions on forming groups along with tips on how to deal with the challenges that may come up. The site became a way to help other schools form groups and to provide suggestions on making their campuses more \u201cdiabetes friendly\u201d.

Additionally, we seek to help each other embrace and be proud of our identities as first generation low-income college students, and to raise awareness of the positive impact that first generation low-income college students have on the UMass campus. We seek to advocate for the first-generation and low-income student community, working to solve campus, statewide, and national issues such as college affordability that disproportionately affects our students.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0purpose\u00a0of the First Generation Low-Income Student Partnership is to build a community that allows first-gen and/or low-income students to encourage each other and support our overall academic success.\u00a0 Being a first generation college student (\u201cfirst-gen\u201d) is defined differently in different contexts, but generally refers to students whose parent(s) or guardian(s) have not received a bachelor\u2019s degree. Because their parent(s) have not graduated from college, first-gen students have extra obstacles to overcome stemming from our parents\u2019 lack of familiarity with higher education; these impediments means we are less likely to graduate or succeed. Such a group is necessary at an institution like the University of Massachusetts where roughly 30% of the student body is comprised of first-gen students. Low-income students are more difficult to define, but this would be defined as any student who feels they are affected by financial instability, have low monetary support at the university, and more.\u00a0Five years from now, our\u00a0vision\u00a0is that this group will still exist as a space for students, and we are hoping that the university will take more initiatives to build support for first generation and/or low-income students as well. In the future, our hope is that there will be collaboration between our RSO and administrators to have an implemented support structure.

We strive to create a tight knit community for support and advocacy..DESCRIPTION: The mission of\u00a0 the UMass First-Generation Low-Income Student Partnership is to create and maintain a space and community dedicated to first generation and low-income college students. We strive to create a tight knit community to provide support to each other to succeed in all aspects of life -- academically, socially, financially, and emotionally. Additionally, we seek to help each other embrace and be proud of our identities as first generation low-income college students, and to raise awareness of the positive impact that first generation low-income college students have on the UMass campus. We seek to advocate for the first-generation and low-income student community, working to solve campus, statewide, and national issues such as college affordability that disproportionately affects our students.\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of the First Generation Low-Income Student Partnership is to build a community that allows first-gen and/or low-income students to encourage each other and support our overall academic success.\u00a0 Being a first generation college student (\u201cfirst-gen\u201d) is defined differently in different contexts, but generally refers to students whose parent(s) or guardian(s) have not received a bachelor\u2019s degree. Because their parent(s) have not graduated from college, first-gen students have extra obstacles to overcome stemming from our parents\u2019 lack of familiarity with higher education; these impediments means we are less likely to graduate or succeed. Such a group is necessary at an institution like the University of Massachusetts where roughly 30% of the student body is comprised of first-gen students. Low-income students are more difficult to define, but this would be defined as any student who feels they are affected by financial instability, have low monetary support at the university, and more.\u00a0Five years from now, our vision is that this group will still exist as a space for students, and we are hoping that the university will take more initiatives to build support for first generation and/or low-income students as well. In the future, our hope is that there will be collaboration between our RSO and administrators to have an implemented support structure. We hope to increase our membership to the point where we can run advocacy campaigns and educational events regularly to educate the campus community on the first-generation low-income student experience. We hope to partner with the FLIP National to further achieve our goals as an official chapter of their organization, aiding our fundraising, outreach, and advocacy endeavours.\u00a0",

In the theoretical part, the knowledge of ancient masters is taught by applying the latest physical, scientific and physiologic.DESCRIPTION: \u00a0About VenakeyThroughout the history,\u00a0the human being has always encountered mysteries without any explanation which permanently irritates him. There has been all the time an inner voice shouting from an unknown part inside: \u201cyou have to find out the answer\u2026.\u201d. Thus in every period of history ,by utilizing what he knows at the time, human has tried to find out an answer in order to be released from the inside pressure. However, since the answers of different nations to these questions were not the same, they have been always involved in an undesirable interminable war. A war which was not mainly for the sake of the truth but rather for sustaining the relief obtained by their so called answers via physical elimination of opponents; just to get rid of their inside torture of unknown.\u00a0One of the enigmas that human has been involved in from prehistory hitherto, is the mysteries around sleeping and awareness. For example there were people who could dream about an event happening in the future; or as their body was in sleep, they started walking or talking; or sometimes they could see their own sleeping bodies from the above.These types of events were the origin of forming the beliefs which gradually expanded and made schools, philosophies and\u00a0faiths.Venakey, which means \u201centering to\u00a0lightening\u201d is among these schools of thought and philosophies which has its root in human\u2019s curiosities and beliefs originated from prehistory. This school of thought is not based on the beliefs of just one nation but relied on all preliminary faiths of human kind.\u00a0 Conversely, it can be said that most of methods and beliefs are typically a branch of Venakey.The basis of this thought has its root in contemplation of ancient masters in the natural processes of sleeping. They observed that human sleeping has formed of three major stages:\u00a0somatic (bodily),\u00a0sensual\u00a0and spiritual.\u00a0The first stage is named somatic sleep that occurs early at night. In order to become calm and motionless, creature's body begins to be calmed down gradually until its excitation due to external stimuli and daily activities stops completely; like an electrical fan, which continues rotating after being turned off and slowly becomes motionless.In this stage people mostly dream their daily activities and after that according tothe ancient masters, they become suddenly awake which appears in the form of movement of sleeping person and then\u00a0 they enter into a deeper sleep stage; sensual stage.\u00a0In this stage, subconscious mind starts resolving difficulties; it means that it reconstructs the obsessions,\u00a0failed\u00a0desires, fears and failures again in a new form and try to resolve and compensate them on the way the sleeping person desires. For instance, if he is defeated in a quarrel and be injured physically or hurt mentally during the day, he might dream a battle in which he is victorious over his opponent.\u00a0After the sensual stage, dreamer enters into the third stage; spiritual one.\u00a0By relaxation of body and also omission of inner turbulences, human mind gains the opportunity to perceive tiny intangible stimuli through hidden senses and unique perceptive channels by which he can dream very close to reality. This part of dream is influenced by sub-conscious mind and telepathic communication with surrounding. During this stage of sleep, the brain is more activated and its metabolism may increase up to 20%, in such a way that brain waves become similar to those of wakefulness; surprisingly this is a contradictory phenomenon in which although the person is asleep but the brain is in a awaken alike activity.\u00a0That\u2019s why, along the history, some great eastern masters decided to use sleeping for gaining knowledge and discovering the very existing universe through connecting to sub-conscious mind and telepathy waves. By these methods, they were not only able to be aware of future and past hidden events but also it turn possible for them to communicate with creatures such as plants, animals and non-organic beings. Therefore, they decided to set up some methods in order to attain\u00a0spiritual dreaming (the third level of dream) in normal wakefulness. They knew that for attaining this level, bodily excitations and mind anxiety must reach to its minimum level.\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, internal dialogue must be completely extinguished; internal dialogue (talking internally to yourself) is a kind of talking by which people continuously review past, present and future of themselves and others; but mistakenly call it'' thinking'', whereas these dialogues are too scattered, inconsistent, irrelevant, sickening and chaotic to be called thought; which no logical relation can be found among them. This internal dialogue scatters mental power and decreasesawareness level as well as consuming a considerable amount of body\u2019s energy; and finally it\u00a0 disconnects the main attention of human being from environmental stimuli.Accordingly, they divided their methods and trainings (Venakey) into two parts. At First part, they used methods to extinguish internal dialogue compulsorily by deceiving mind, and conduct body to its most relaxing possible state, by which mind and body become relaxed and go deep into a sleeping similar sate.\u00a0 By this way, they could pass the conscious from somatic sleep stage in wakefulness. The second part of their training was designed for passing sensual sleep, regarding to the fact that sensual sleep is originated from mental excitations, which is imposed on human by environment or inner instincts; it was somewhat complicated, since the rate of domination on it was related to the rate of awareness and knowledge of human being mind.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ancient masters also recognized that human beings are unable to act merely based on their own knowledge. Hence they tried to made use of three special sensations fear, pleasure and love to\u00a0instigate their followers to do their instructions seriously, since they found out that these three factors are the main motives of human kind.\u00a0 This is the fear of unknown which makes human beings fanatical. This is the greed of gaining more pleasure in the afterworld, which attracts people to do recommended religious percepts; and finally, this is through love which tolerating pains and shortcomings turns possible.\u00a0 At first stages, some masters proposed monastic life and staying away from any sensual excitations via establishing temples or seeking caves in faraway places trying to purge this stage of dream by which they could attain\u00a0some good achievements.\u00a0 Later, these schools of thought succeeded in exploring special remedial methods, via telepathic communication with plants and animals, including acupuncture, cupping (bleed by cupping) and\u00a0herbal-therapy. By attaining special abilities in being connected to other creatures, they acquired more knowledge about the human being totality, the existing universe and truth which formed tenets of their philosophy.\u00a0Ancient masters found out that independent of one\u2019s beliefs and thoughts and lifestyles, these methods can work. That is even without caring about complicated questions such as: where is our origin? What is our destiny? how has our childhood been passed and with whichdifficulties or how social beliefs influences (positively or negatively) our beliefs, we can still make a successful, calm, healthy , attractive, wise and powerful, positive and full of joy ones out of ourselves. We are still capable of being a novel human with versified personalities. Thus, they engaged in designing and training methods, which could help human beings to reach these goals.Venakey is a method which is originated from the ancient times. This method has been taught and developed academically since 1989 by Master Mohammad Babaee for the first time in modern times.\u00a0 Making this method worldwide, Master Mohmmad baabee has decided to proliferate it in USA.Functions:This method consists of two parts:\u00a0 Theoretical and Practicala.Theoretical:In this part, the knowledge of ancient masters is taught by applying the latest physical, scientific and physiological findings to the students in order to change their viewpoint to negative environmental and sensorial stimulus and enhance their positive feelings in result. Consequently, their resistance and mental happiness will be improved.majority of people have minimum level of control on their negative physical and mental excitations and as a result physiological demands usually dominate their logical ones. Thus, for students who desire to improve their health quality, some techniques are taught which help them dominating their physiology more easily and lead their bodies and minds to health and tolerance.\u00a0These techniques are included three major parts:1.Sub-conscious related techniques which are similar to hypnotism but not exactly the same.2.Bodily techniques such as breathing and specific forms of exercise.3.Mental techniques which are similar to meditation and concentration exercises but in a very special and unique manner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results:thousand years experience of ancient masters and 23 years of Master\u00a0 Mohammad Babaee\u2019s practical experience illustrates that this method leads to the following results:Physical effects:Enhancing the body Immune system and resistance to diseases.\u00a0Impressive improving of memory and learning skillsResolving\u00a0many diseases like digestive diseases, Allergy, Muscular pains, obesity, insomnia, migraine, and many other physical illnesses.Improving the physical power\u00a0and stamina\u00a0for athletes and elders, enhancing the level of alertness and as a result increasing creativity and intelligence.Eliminating cramps and muscular pains caused by intense physical activities.Increasing\u00a0happiness, energy, physical and mental spirit.The best replacement for sleep when awareness is needed.\u00a0Spiritual and mental effects:Enhancing the level of mental resistance that causes the person to be more tolerant against social, environmental and familial adversities and act more effectively and accurately.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Renovation of individual\u2019s\u00a0attitude to himself and his environment which results in better understanding of people and improving their relationship.\u00a0Dominance of happiness, hope and vitality over the agents and also the society.\u00a0Keywords: Spirituality, Spirit, Spiritual, Lucid Dreaming, Chakra, Meditation, Reiki, Tai chi, \u00a0Qi Gong, Mantra, Spiritual Dance,\u00a0yoga,\u00a0Reiki,\u00a0Healing,\u00a0Aura Sight,\u00a0Energy Healing,\u00a0New Age,\u00a0Metaphysics,\u00a0Paranorma,\u00a0Telepathy,\u00a0Hypnosis",

    "NAME: World Librarians.CATEGORIES: Registered Student Organizations, Service & Engagement Council.SUMMARY: TBD.DESCRIPTION: The Internet has transformed access to information. The Internet also plays a large role in improving education. However, over 4 billion people do not have access to the Internet, and their development is consequently stymied simply due to a lack of access. The World Librarians is an initiative developed at the University of Massachusetts Amherst that connects offline learners to open educational content in a democratic way. This initiative bridges the digital divide through inexpensive technology and Open Educational Resources. Created by a team of researchers who partnered with institutions across the globe, World Librarians has developed a workflow that connects an offline educational institution with the information it needs. First, a Requester, an individual from an offline educational institution, uses Twitter or e-Mule to request information. Second, a Searcher, a World Librarians team member with unlimited access to the Internet, looks for Open Access (e.g., Creative Commons) Licensed information. Third, the Searcher sends the relevant content to the Courier. Finally, the Courier, an individual or group with access to the Internet located in the area of the Requester, physically transports the data via USB drive to the Requester for their use. World Librarians is bridging the digital divide by providing open access information through a process titled Commons-based Peer Production or \u201cPeer Production\u201d for short. Rather than focusing on the provision of free Wi-Fi, World Librarians focus on the impact of the Internet: the ability to accelerate economic development by providing increased access to information. A UMass research team is currently working with a key partner in Malawi, Carl Meyer of a nonprofit ShiftIT, to improve access to educational information to a network of libraries and schools without access to the Internet. To do this, we developed a process that utilizes a device called a RACHEL (Remote Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning) Plus, which was created by World Possible, with the help of Intel. We also use technology to communicate with the institutions we are providing content to. The World Librarian\u2019s initiative connects offline learners to open educational resources in a democratic way.",
