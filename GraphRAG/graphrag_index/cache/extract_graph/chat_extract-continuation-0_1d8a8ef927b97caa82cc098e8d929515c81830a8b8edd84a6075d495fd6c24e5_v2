No. 280. 1 ft. 0-1/2 ins. by\n1 ft. 4 ins. (0.32 x 0.40)]\n\nThe copy of the \"Last Supper\" (Plate V.) by Marco d'Oggiono, now in\nthe Diploma Gallery at Burlington House, was made shortly after the\noriginal painting was completed. It gives but a faint echo of that\nsublime work \"in which the ideal and the real were blended in perfect\nunity.\" This copy was long in the possession of the Carthusians in\ntheir Convent at Pavia, and, on the suppression of that Order and\nthe sale of their effects in 1793, passed into the possession of a\ngrocer at Milan. It was subsequently purchased for £600 by the Royal\nAcademy on the advice of Sir Thomas Lawrence, who left no stone\nunturned to acquire also the original studies for the heads of the\nApostles. Some of these in red and black chalk are now preserved\nin the Royal Library at Windsor, where there are in all 145 drawings\nby Leonardo.\n\nSeveral other old copies of the fresco exist, notably the one in the\nLouvre. Francis I. wished to remove the whole wall of the Refectory to\nParis, but he was persuaded that that would be impossible; the\nConstable de Montmorency then had a copy made for the Chapel of the\nChâteau d'Ecouen, whence it ultimately passed to the Louvre.\n\nThe singularly beautiful \"Head of Christ\" (Plate VI.), now in the\nBrera Gallery at Milan, is the original study for the head of the\nprincipal figure in the fresco painting of the \"Last Supper.\" In\nspite of decay and restoration it expresses \"the most elevated\nseriousness together with Divine Gentleness, pain on account of\nthe faithlessness of His disciples, a full presentiment of His own\ndeath, and resignation to the will of His Father.\"\n\n\n\nTHE COURT OF MILAN\n\nLudovico, to whom Leonardo was now court-painter, had married Beatrice\nd'Este, in 1491, when she was only fifteen years of age. The young\nDuchess, who at one time owned as many as eighty-four splendid gowns,\nrefused to wear a certain dress of woven gold, which her husband had\ngiven her, if Cecilia Gallerani, the Sappho of her day, continued to\nwear a very similar one, which presumably had been given to her by\nLudovico. Having discarded Cecilia, who, as her tastes did not lie in\nthe direction of the Convent, was married in 1491 to Count Ludovico\nBergamini, the Duke in 1496 became enamoured of Lucrezia Crivelli, a\nlady-in-waiting to the Duchess Beatrice.\n\nLeonardo, as court painter, perhaps painted a portrait, now lost, of\nLucrezia, whose features are more likely to be preserved to us in the\nportrait by Ambrogio da Predis, now in the Collection of the Earl of\nRoden, than in the quite unauthenticated portrait (Plate VII.), now in\nthe Louvre (No. 1600).\n\nOn January 2, 1497, Beatrice spent three hours in prayer in the church\nof St. Maria delle Grazie, and the same night gave birth to a\nstillborn child. In a few hours she passed away, and from that moment\nLudovico was a changed man. He went daily to see her tomb, and was\nquite overcome with grief.\n\nIn April 1498, Isabella d'Este, Beatrice's elder, more beautiful, and\nmore graceful sister, \"at the sound of whose name all the muses rise\nand do reverence\" wrote to Cecilia Gallerani, or Bergamini, asking her\nto lend her the portrait which Leonardo had painted of her some\nfifteen years earlier, as she wished to compare it with a picture by\nGiovanni Bellini. Cecilia graciously lent the picture--now presumably\nlost--adding her regret that it no longer resembled her.\n\n\n\nLEONARDO LEAVES MILAN\n\nAmong the last of Leonardo da Vinci's works in Milan towards the end\nof 1499 was, probably, the superb cartoon of \"The Virgin and Child\nwith St. Anne and St. John,\" now at Burlington House. Though little\nknown to the general public, this large drawing on _carton_, or\nstiff paper, is one of the greatest of London's treasures, as it\nreveals the sweeping line of Leonardo's powerful draughtsmanship. It\nwas in the Pompeo Leoni, Arconati, Casnedi, and Udney Collections\nbefore passing to the Royal Academy.\n\nIn 1499 the stormy times in Milan foreboded the end of Ludovico's\nreign. In April of that year we read of his giving a vineyard to\nLeonardo; in September Ludovico had to leave Milan for the Tyrol to\nraise an army, and on the 14th of the same month the city was sold by\nBernardino di Corte to the French, who occupied it from 1500 to 1512.\nLudovico may well have had in mind the figure of the traitor in the\n\"Last Supper\" when he declared that \"Since the days of Judas Iscariot\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRERA GALLERY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Brera Gallery is an art gallery in Milan, known for housing significant works of art, including the Head of Christ.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILAN<|>GEO<|>Milan is a major city in Italy, known for its historical and cultural significance, including art galleries and museums.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAST SUPPER<|>EVENT<|>The Last Supper is a famous mural painting by Leonardo da Vinci, depicting the last meal of Jesus with his disciples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEONARDO DA VINCI<|>PERSON<|>Leonardo da Vinci was a renowned Italian artist and polymath, known for his contributions to art, science, and engineering.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCHESS BEATRICE<|>PERSON<|>Beatrice d'Este was the Duchess of Milan, married to Ludovico Sforza, known for her beauty and influence in the court.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cecilia Gallerani<|>PERSON<|>Cecilia Gallerani was a lady-in-waiting and the subject of a portrait by Leonardo da Vinci, known for her beauty and intellect.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISABELLA D'ESTE<|>PERSON<|>Isabella d'Este was the sister of Beatrice d'Este, known for her beauty and cultural influence during the Renaissance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUDOVICO SFORZA<|>PERSON<|>Ludovico Sforza was the Duke of Milan, known for his patronage of the arts and his tumultuous reign.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST.
