There also Leonardo came into contact with that unoriginal\npainter Lorenzo di Credi, his junior by seven years. He also, no\ndoubt, met Perugino, whom Michelangelo called \"that blockhead in art.\"\nThe genius and versatility of the Vincian painter was, however, in no\nway dulled by intercourse with lesser artists than himself; on the\ncontrary he vied with each in turn, and readily outstripped his fellow\npupils. In 1472, at the age of twenty, he was admitted into the Guild\nof Florentine Painters.\n\nUnfortunately very few of Leonardo's paintings have come down to us.\nIndeed there do not exist a sufficient number of finished and\nabsolutely authentic oil pictures from his own hand to afford\nillustrations for this short chronological sketch of his life's work.\nThe few that do remain, however, are of so exquisite a quality--or\nwere until they were \"comforted\" by the uninspired restorer--that we\ncan unreservedly accept the enthusiastic records of tradition in\nrespect of all his works. To rightly understand the essential\ncharacteristics of Leonardo's achievements it is necessary to\nregard him as a scientist quite as much as an artist, as a philosopher\nno less than a painter, and as a draughtsman rather than a colourist.\nThere is hardly a branch of human learning to which he did not at\none time or another give his eager attention, and he was engrossed in\nturn by the study of architecture--the foundation-stone of all true\nart--sculpture, mathematics, engineering and music. His versatility\nwas unbounded, and we are apt to regret that this many-sided genius\ndid not realise that it is by developing his power within certain\nlimits that the great master is revealed. Leonardo may be described as\nthe most Universal Genius of Christian times-perhaps of all time.\n\n[Illustration: PLATE III.-THE VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS\n\nIn the National Gallery. No. 1093. 6 ft. ¬Ω in. h. by 3 ft 9 ¬Ω in. w.\n(1.83 x 1.15)\n\nThis picture was painted in Milan about 1495 by Ambrogio da Predis\nunder the supervision and guidance of Leonardo da Vinci, the\nessential features of the composition being borrowed from the earlier\n\"Vierge aux Rochers,\" now in the Louvre.]\n\n\n\n\nHIS EARLY WORKS\n\nTo about the year 1472 belongs the small picture of the\n\"Annunciation,\" now in the Louvre, which after being the subject of\nmuch contention among European critics has gradually won its way to\ngeneral recognition as an early work by Leonardo himself. That it was\npainted in the studio of Verrocchio was always admitted, but it was\nlong catalogued by the Louvre authorities under the name of Lorenzo di\nCredi. It is now, however, attributed to Leonardo (No. 1602 A). Such\nuncertainties as to attribution were common half a century ago when\nscientific art criticism was in its infancy.\n\nAnother painting of the \"Annunciation,\" which is now in the Uffizi\nGallery (No. 1288) is still officially attributed to Leonardo. This\nsmall picture, which has been considerably repainted, and is perhaps\nby Andrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo's master, is the subject of Plate\nII.\n\nTo January 1473 belongs Leonardo's earliest dated work, a pen-and-ink\ndrawing--\"A Wide View over a Plain,\" now in the Uffizi. The\ninscription together with the date in the top left-hand corner is\nreversed, and proves a remarkable characteristic of Leonardo's\nhandwriting--viz., that he wrote from right to left; indeed, it has\nbeen suggested that he did this in order to make it difficult for any\none else to read the words, which were frequently committed to paper\nby the aid of peculiar abbreviations.\n\nLeonardo continued to work in his master's studio till about 1477. On\nJanuary 1st of the following year, 1478, he was commissioned to paint\nan altar-piece for the Chapel of St. Bernardo in the Palazzo Vecchio,\nand he was paid twenty-five florins on account. He, however, never\ncarried out the work, and after waiting five years the Signoria\ntransferred the commission to Domenico Ghirlandajo, who also failed to\naccomplish the task, which was ultimately, some seven years later,\ncompleted by Filippino Lippi. This panel of the \"Madonna Enthroned,\nSt. Victor, St. John Baptist, St. Bernard, and St. Zenobius,\" which is\ndated February 20, 1485, is now in the Uffizi.\n\nThat Leonardo was by this time a facile draughtsman is evidenced by\nhis vigorous pen-and-ink sketch--now in a private collection in\nParis--of Bernardo Bandini, who in the Pazzi Conspiracy of April 1478\nstabbed Giuliano de' Medici to death in the Cathedral at Florence\nduring High Mass. The drawing is dated December 29, 1479, the date of\nBandini's public execution in Florence.\n\nIn that year also, no doubt, was painted the early and, as might\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOTTICELLI<|>PERSON<|>Botticelli was a jovial painter and a member of the Poetical Supper Club during his development as an artist.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEONARDO DA VINCI<|>PERSON<|>Leonardo da Vinci was a versatile artist and scientist, known for his genius in various fields including painting, architecture, and engineering.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LORENZO DI CREDI<|>PERSON<|>Lorenzo di Credi was an unoriginal painter and a junior to Leonardo da Vinci by seven years.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERUGINO<|>PERSON<|>Perugino was a painter who was referred to as \"that blockhead in art\" by Michelangelo.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUILD OF FLORENTINE PAINTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Guild of Florentine Painters is an organization that Leonardo da Vinci was admitted to at the age of twenty in 1472.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNUNCIATION<|>EVENT<|>The Annunciation is a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, recognized as one of his early works.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALAZZO VECCHIO<|>GEO<|>Palazzo Vecchio is a historical building in Florence where Leonardo was commissioned to paint an altar-piece.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UFFIZI GALLERY<|>GEO<|>The Uffizi Gallery is an art museum in Florence that houses several works attributed to Leonardo da Vinci.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADONNA ENTHRONED<|>EVENT<|>The Madonna Enthroned is a panel painting commissioned to Leonardo da Vinci, which was ultimately completed by Filippino Lippi.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERNARDO BANDINI<|>PERSON<|>Bernardo Bandini was involved in the Pazzi Conspiracy and was executed for stabbing Giuliano de' Medici.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO DA VINCI<|>BOTTICELLI<|>Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli were contemporaries and met at the Poetical Supper Club, where they interacted with other artists.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO DA VINCI<|>LORENZO DI CREDI<|>Leonardo da Vinci was a senior to Lorenzo di Credi, who was his junior by seven years.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO DA VINCI<|>PERUGINO<|>Leonardo da Vinci came into contact with Perugino, who was noted for his lesser artistic skills.<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO DA VINCI<|>GUILD OF FLORENTINE PAINTERS<|>Leonardo da Vinci was admitted to the Guild of Florentine Painters in 1472, marking a significant step in his career.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNUNCIATION<|>UFFIZI GALLERY<|>The Annunciation is currently housed in the Uffizi Gallery and is attributed to Leonardo da Vinci.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO DA VINCI<|>PALAZZO VECCHIO<|>Leonardo was commissioned to paint an altar-piece for the Chapel of St. Bernardo in the Palazzo Vecchio.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MADONNA ENTHRONED<|>PALAZZO VECCHIO<|>The Madonna Enthroned was commissioned for the Palazzo Vecchio and was ultimately completed by Filippino Lippi.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO DA VINCI<|>BERNARDO BANDINI<|>Leonardo da Vinci created a sketch of Bernardo Bandini, who was executed for his role in the Pazzi Conspiracy.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
