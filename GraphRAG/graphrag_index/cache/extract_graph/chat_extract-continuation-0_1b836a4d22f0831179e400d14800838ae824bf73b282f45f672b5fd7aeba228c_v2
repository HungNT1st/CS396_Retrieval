It has,\nhowever, been surmised that that lady's features are preserved to us\nin the \"Lady with a Weasel,\" by Leonardo's pupil Boltraffio, which is\nnow in the Czartoryski Collection at Cracow.\n\n\n\n\nIN THE EAST\n\nThe absence of any record of Leonardo in Milan, or elsewhere in Italy,\nbetween 1483 and 1487 has led critics to the conclusion, based on\ndocumentary evidence of a somewhat complicated nature, that he spent\nthose years in the service of the Sultan of Egypt, travelling in\nArmenia and the East as his engineer.\n\n\n\nBACK IN MILAN\n\n\nIn 1487 he was again resident in Milan as general artificer--using\nthat term in its widest sense--to Ludovico. Among his various\nactivities at this period must be mentioned the designs he made for\nthe cupola of the cathedral at Milan, and the scenery he constructed\nfor \"Il Paradiso,\" which was written by Bernardo Bellincioni on the\noccasion of the marriage of Gian Galeazzo with Isabella of Aragon.\nAbout 1489-1490 he began his celebrated \"Treatise on Painting\" and\nrecommenced work on the colossal equestrian statue of Francesco\nSforza, which was doubtless the greatest of all his achievements as a\nsculptor. It was, however, never cast in bronze, and was ruthlessly\ndestroyed by the French bowmen in April 1500, on their occupation of\nMilan after the defeat of Ludovico at the battle of Novara. This is\nall the more regrettable as no single authentic piece of sculpture\nhas come down to us from Leonardo's hand, and we can only judge of his\npower in this direction from his drawings, and the enthusiastic\npraise of his contemporaries.\n\n[Illustration: PLATE V.--COPY OF THE LAST SUPPER\n\nIn the Diploma Gallery, Burlington House\n\nThis copy is usually ascribed to Marco d'Oggiono, but some critics\nclaim that it is by Gianpetrino. It is the same size as the original.]\n\n\n\nTHE VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS\n\n\nThe \"Virgin of the Rocks\" (Plate III.), now in the National Gallery,\ncorresponds exactly with a painting by Leonardo which was described by\nLomazzo about 1584 as being in the Chapel of the Conception in the\nChurch of St. Francesco at Milan. This picture, the only _oeuvre_\nin this gallery with which Leonardo's name can be connected, was\nbrought to England in 1777 by Gavin Hamilton, and sold by him to the\nMarquess of Lansdowne, who subsequently exchanged it for another\npicture in the Collection of the Earl of Suffolk at Charlton Park,\nWiltshire, from whom it was eventually purchased by the National\nGallery for £9000. Signor Emilio Motta, some fifteen years ago,\nunearthed in the State Archives of Milan a letter or memorial from\nGiovanni Ambrogio da Predis and Leonardo da Vinci to the Duke of\nMilan, praying him to intervene in a dispute, which had arisen between\nthe petitioners and the Brotherhood of the Conception, with regard to\nthe valuation of certain works of art furnished for the chapel of the\nBrotherhood in the church of St. Francesco. The only logical deduction\nwhich can be drawn from documentary evidence is that the \"Vierge aux\nRochers\" in the Louvre is the picture, painted about 1482, which\nbetween 1491 and 1494 gave rise to the dispute, and that, when it was\nultimately sold by the artists for the full price asked to some\nunknown buyer, the National Gallery version was executed for a\nsmaller price mainly by Ambrogio da Predisunder the supervision, and\nwith the help, of Leonardo to be placed in the Chapel of the\nConception.\n\nThe differences between the earlier, the more authentic, and the more\ncharacteristically Florentine \"Vierge aux Rochers,\" in the Louvre, and\nthe \"Virgin of the Rocks,\" in the National Gallery, are that in the\nlatter picture the hand of the angel, seated by the side of the Infant\nChrist, is raised and pointed in the direction of the little St. John\nthe Baptist; that the St John has a reed cross and the three principal\nfigures have gilt nimbi, which were, however, evidently added much\nlater. In the National Gallery version the left hand of the Madonna,\nthe Christ's right hand and arm, and the forehead of St. John the\nBaptist are freely restored, while a strip of the foreground right\nacross the whole picture is ill painted and lacks accent. The head of\nthe angel is, however, magnificently painted, and by Leonardo; the\npanel, taken as a whole, is exceedingly beautiful and full of charm\nand tenderness.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST SUPPER\n\nBetween 1496 and 1498 Leonardo painted his _chef d'oeuvre_, the\n\"Last Supper,\" (Plate IV.) for the end wall of the Refectory of the\nDominican Convent of S. Maria delle Grazie at Milan.
