Before the end of the year\nLeonardo, realising the necessity for his speedy departure, sent six\nhundred gold florins by letter of exchange to Florence to be placed\nto his credit with the hospital of S. Maria Nuova.\n\nIn the following year, Ludovico having been defeated at Novara,\nLeonardo was a homeless wanderer. He left Milan for Mantua, where he\ndrew a portrait in chalk of Isabella d'Este, which is now in the\nLouvre. Leonardo eventually arrived in Florence about Easter 1500.\nAfter apparently working there in 1501 on a second Cartoon, similar in\nmost respects to the one he had executed in Milan two years earlier,\nhe travelled in Umbria, visiting Orvieto, Pesaro, Rimini, and other\ntowns, acting as engineer and architect to Cesare Borgia, for whom he\nplanned a navigable canal between Cesena and Porto Cese-natico.\n\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.-PORTRAIT (PRESUMED) OF LUCREZIA CRIVELLI\n\nIn the Louvre. No. 1600 [483]. 2 ft by I ft 5 ins. (0.62 x 0.44)\n\nThis picture, although officially attributed to Leonardo, is probably\nnot by him, and almost certainly does not represent Lucrezia Crivelli.\nIt was once known as a \"Portrait of a Lady\" and is still occasionally\nmiscalled \"La Belle Féronnière.\"]\n\n\n\nMONA LISA\n\nEarly in 1503 he was back again in Florence, and set to work in\nearnest on the \"Portrait of Mona Lisa\" (Plate I.), now in the Louvre\n(No. 1601). Lisa di Anton Maria di Noldo Gherardini was the daughter\nof Antonio Gherardini. In 1495 she married Francesco di Bartolommeo de\nZenobi del Giocondo. It is from the surname of her husband that she\nderives the name of \"La Joconde,\" by which her portrait is officially\nknown in the Louvre. Vasari is probably inaccurate in saying that\nLeonardo \"loitered over it for four years, and finally left it\nunfinished.\" He may have begun it in the spring of 1501 and, probably\nowing to having taken service under Cesare Borgia in the following\nyear, put it on one side, ultimately completing it after working on\nthe \"Battle of Anghiari\" in 1504. Vasari's eulogy of this portrait may\nwith advantage be quoted: \"Whoever shall desire to see how far art can\nimitate nature may do so to perfection in this head, wherein every\npeculiarity that could be depicted by the utmost subtlety of the\npencil has been faithfully reproduced. The eyes have the lustrous\nbrightness and moisture which is seen in life, and around them are\nthose pale, red, and slightly livid circles, also proper to nature.\nThe nose, with its beautiful and delicately roseate nostrils, might be\neasily believed to be alive; the mouth, admirable in its outline, has\nthe lips uniting the rose-tints of their colour with those of the\nface, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of the cheek does\nnot appear to be painted, but truly flesh and blood. He who looks\nearnestly at the pit of the throat cannot but believe that he sees the\nbeating of the pulses. Mona Lisa was exceedingly beautiful, and while\nLeonardo was painting her portrait, he took the precaution of keeping\nsome one constantly near her to sing or play on instruments, or to\njest and otherwise amuse her.\"\n\nLeonardo painted this picture in the full maturity of his talent, and,\nalthough it is now little more than a monochrome owing to the free and\nmerciless restoration to which it has been at times subjected, it must\nhave created a wonderful impression on those who saw it in the early\nyears of the sixteenth century. It is difficult for the unpractised\neye to-day to form any idea of its original beauty. Leonardo has here\npainted this worldly-minded woman--her portrait is much more famous\nthan she herself ever was--with a marvellous charm and suavity, a\nfinesse of expression never reached before and hardly ever equalled\nsince. Contrast the head of the Christ at Milan, Leonardo's conception\nof divinity expressed in perfect humanity, with the subtle and\nsphinx-like smile of this languorous creature.\n\nThe landscape background, against which Mona Lisa is posed, recalls\nthe severe, rather than exuberant, landscape and the dim vistas of\nmountain ranges seen in the neighbourhood of his own birthplace. The\nportrait was bought during the reign of Francis I. for a sum which is\nto-day equal to about £1800. Leonardo, by the way, does not seem to\nhave been really affected by any individual affection for any woman,\nand, like Michelangelo and Raphael, never married.\n\nIn\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LEONARDO<|>PERSON<|>Leonardo is a renowned artist and polymath known for his contributions to art, science, and engineering during the Renaissance period.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILAN<|>GEO<|>Milan is a city in Italy where Leonardo worked and created several of his famous artworks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYROL<|>GEO<|>Tyrol is a region that Ludovico left Milan for in order to raise an army.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERNARDINO DI CORTE<|>PERSON<|>Bernardino di Corte was a figure who sold Milan to the French and is referred to as a traitor by Ludovico.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOUIS XII<|>PERSON<|>Louis XII was the French king who entered Milan on October 6th.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLORENCE<|>GEO<|>Florence is a city in Italy where Leonardo sent gold florins and later returned to work on his art.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISABELLA D'ESTE<|>PERSON<|>Isabella d'Este was a noblewoman for whom Leonardo drew a portrait in Mantua.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANTUA<|>GEO<|>Mantua is a city in Italy where Leonardo created a portrait of Isabella d'Este.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOUVRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Louvre is a famous museum in Paris where many of Leonardo's works, including the Mona Lisa, are housed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONA LISA<|>EVENT<|>The Mona Lisa is a famous portrait painted by Leonardo, known for its artistic mastery and enigmatic expression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CESARE BORGIA<|>PERSON<|>Cesare Borgia was a military leader for whom Leonardo worked as an engineer and architect.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BATTLE OF ANGHARI<|>EVENT<|>The Battle of Anghiari is a historical event that Leonardo worked on after completing the Mona Lisa.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO<|>MILAN<|>Leonardo worked in Milan, creating many of his famous artworks during the Renaissance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUDOVICO<|>MILAN<|>Ludovico was a ruler of Milan who had to leave the city to raise an army<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERNARDINO DI CORTE<|>MILAN<|>Bernardino di Corte sold Milan to the French, leading to its occupation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOUIS XII<|>MILAN<|>Louis XII entered Milan as the French king after its sale<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO<|>FLORENCE<|>Leonardo sent gold florins to Florence and later returned to work on his art there<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO<|>ISABELLA D'ESTE<|>Leonardo drew a portrait of Isabella d'Este in Mantua<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO<|>LOUVRE<|>The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo, is housed in the Louvre<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO<|>MONA LISA<|>Leonardo is the artist who painted the Mona Lisa, a significant work of art<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO<|>CESARE BORGIA<|>Leonardo worked for Cesare Borgia as an engineer and architect<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO<|>BATTLE OF ANGHARI<|>Leonardo worked on the Battle of Anghiari after completing the Mona Lisa<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
